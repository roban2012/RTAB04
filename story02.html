CURRICULAR RENEWAL IN HARVARD COLLEGE<br><br>
LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS（第27条）<br><br>

27. The Committee reaffirms Harvard’s long-standing requirement that students complete a course dedicated to effective writing in the first year. We also support the current requirement that all students demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language. However, in order to provide first-year students with more flexibility, we will no longer expect that the language requirement be met in the freshman year. Rather, we ecommend that the language requirement be fulfilled by the end of the second year. Further, we believe that all Harvard College students should be expected to participate in a significant international experience.<br><br>

北大外国语学院院长程朝翔：美国哈佛大学2004年的本科评估报告，也是当时同文馆的思路：在全球化时代的本科教育中，要大力强化外语和科学教育。<br><br>
北大外国语言文学学科的建制屡有变迁。这一变迁的历史，对我们启示良多。清政府设立京师同文馆，是为了应对时代的挑战，培养西学人才。所以，除了外文类课程外，同文馆还逐渐设置了大量的科学课程。有趣的是，美国哈佛大学2004年的本科评估报告，也是当时同文馆的思路：在全球化时代的本科教育中，要大力强化外语和科学教育。<br><br>
Too Many Kids Quit Science Because They Don't Think They're Smart	<br><br>
But praising their intelligence can make them feel even more insecure. A self-esteem expert offers a way out of the conundrum. 	<br><br>
Alexandra Ossola  Nov 3 2014, 	<br><br>
For most students, science, math, engineering, and technology (STEM) subjects are not intuitive or easy. Learning in general―and STEM in particular―requires repeated trial and error, and a student’s lack of confidence can sometimes stand in her own way. And although teachers and parents may think they are doing otherwise, these adults inadvertently help kids make up their minds early on that they're not natural scientists or “math people,” which leads them to pursue other subjects instead.	<br><br>
So what's the best way to help kids feel confident enough to stay the STEM course? To answer this question, I spoke with Carol Dweck, a professor of psychology at Stanford University in California. Over the past 20 years, Dweck has conducted dozens of studies about praise’s impact on students’ self-esteem and academic achievement. Here is a transcript of our conversation, which has been condensed and lightly edited.	<br><br>
Alexandra Ossola: What sparked your interest in this field?	<br><br>
Carol Dweck: We undertook this research at the height of the self-esteem movement, when the gurus were telling parents and teachers to praise kids to the hills, to tell them how talented, intelligent, brilliant they were. And this was supposed to boost their confidence and set them up for a successful life. And I thought, I don’t think so. When students thought of their intelligence as a thing that’s just fixed, they were vulnerable. They were not willing to take on challenges that might test their intelligence, and they weren’t resilient when they came into obstacles. Would children want to take on challenging things if they think that’s their claim to fame? It would discredit this valuable, permanent quality.	<br><br>
Ossola: What is a mistake that parents and teachers often make when it comes to praising kids?	<br><br>
Dweck: They often praise the ability, the talent, or the intelligence too much. The opposite of this is the good process praise. This is praise for the process the child engages in―their hard work, trying many strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their use of errors to learn, their improvement.	<br><br>
We conducted a study where we recorded videotapes of mothers interacting with babies when they were one, two, and three years old. The more the mothers gave process praise, the more their kids had a growth mindset and a desire for challenge five years later. And now we’re finding how much better those kids are achieving even two years after that.	<br><br>
Gender is relevant: The mothers are giving boys more process praise than they’re giving girls. Years ago we found the same thing in teachers giving feedback.	<br><br>
It’s not that they’re necessarily favoring boys. Even as infants, girls are more socially tuned in, easier to engage, and more able to maintain an interaction. This means that parents may have to work harder to engage boys and keep them engaged in a mutual activity. Parents’ harder work could take the form of more process praise―more narrating and commenting on what the boy is doing, more praise for the strategies they boy is trying, and more praise for attention and persistence.	<br><br>
It’s easy to get a girl to focus on you, and adults react to that. I’m not saying there aren’t stereotypes of girls that aren’t coming in. But this difference could really begin in a seemingly irrelevant biological difference between boys and girls that draws more process focus in parents and teachers, plus teaches boys a good lesson: when you pay attention and work hard, you do better. With girls, who are just self regulating away, they don’t need to give us those lessons. But as a result they think that when adults give them criticism, it’s for something really important. It’s about their ability, how good they are at something.	<br><br>
Ossola: What is the right balance of praise? How much is too much?	<br><br>
Dweck: That hasn’t been as well researched as what to praise. But we did some work, which we haven’t published, and we found that when we gave kids lots and lots of praise then discontinued it, they either lost motivation or they did a variety of strange and distorted things to get the adults’ approval back. There is such a thing as too much praise, we believe. When you praise someone, you are making their actions and performance yours. So they’re looking over their shoulder and not owning their work.	<br><br>
When you praise someone, you are making their actions and performance yours. So they’re looking over their shoulder.	<br><br>
Ossola: Does praise affect people at different places in their academic lives? Can it carry on into adulthood?	<br><br>
Dweck: It can be powerful at any age. Being a good parent has become synonymous with giving out ability praise. Parents still think this is the greatest gift they can give to their children, and as a child gets more and more insecure, they give more and more of it. And, by the way, a lot of employers and coaches have said, “My employees cannot get through the day without accolades and validation.” Even professional coaches have said they cannot give feedback without these people feeling that they’ve crushed them. We’ve created several generations now of very fragile individuals because they’ve been praised and hyped. And feel that anything but praise is devastating. 	<br><br>
Ossola: How can parents and educators foster this resilience to obstacles in other ways?	<br><br>
Dweck: Actually, praise may not be the optimal way, but we are so praise oriented. We can ask the child questions about the process: “How did you do that? Tell me about it.” As they talk about the process and the strategies they tried, we can appreciate it. We can be interested in it. We can encourage it. It doesn’t have to be outright praise.	<br><br>
Turning 3-Year-Olds Into Scientists	<br><br>
They may not be doing algebra, but pre-K kids can master scientific concepts that will make a big difference later on.  Alexandra Ossola Nov 5 2014	<br><br>
Anyone who has spent time with 3- or 4-year-olds knows it can be exhausting. They’re talkative, mobile, and independent, with a penchant for asking questions about everything. But well-structured pre-kindergarten classrooms are designed to harness that unbridled energy into enthusiasm learning. Colorful posters on the walls and stations set up for small group work ensure that kids are engaged in the new concepts and skills they learn.	<br><br>
By the time they set foot in a pre-K classroom, kids have been learning math and science for years. But for many students, this is the first time this learning is structured, where they start attaching names to these concepts in order to better articulate them. Research has shown that this is a critical age for children’s cognitive development; their education at this point lays the foundation for their future academic performance and beyond. Adults can foster this growth by helping to link the more intuitive elements with the way we communicate them, and conveying positive attitudes about math and science.	<br><br>
“Children’s cognitive abilities at the beginning of kindergarten are pretty strong predictors of their academic growth all the way through high school,” said Michele Mazzocco, a professor of child development at the Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Research over the past few decades has connected early childhood education with later academic and even professional success. Part of the reason this stage is so important, according to developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, is that children ages 2 through 7 are in the symbolic function stage of their development. Although not all of his theories were correct, his assessment of period has persisted for almost a century: Children in the symbolic function stage start to connect physical objects to abstract concepts, shaped by instruction in how to communicate these connections as well as the children’s own experience.	<br><br>
When they enter pre-K, children are already thinking about science in the form of cause-and-effect relationships, Mazzocco said. If they do x, then y will happen―the universe has an order and a logic to it. Kids also begin exploring early math and science concepts by observing comparing objects. They’re intuitively drawn to quantities, patterns, shapes, rhythms, symmetry, ratios―“A lot of the informal aspects of math that appear intuitive,” Mazzocco said. Kids are really good at spatial reasoning, she added; they appreciate the ratios and patterns when building with blocks like Legos. These ideas are not as complex as the theory of relativity, obviously. But these concepts that connect the tangible to the abstract lay the foundation for scientific and mathematical thinking that later education can build upon.	<br><br>
This is where adults can start to help, by giving kids a way to express these concepts. “Kids are less intuitively drawn to the symbols we use to communicate math and science,” Mazzocco said. As a child starts to understand the concept of the number two, for example, a teacher or parent can connect that concept to the written symbol: 2. Even though kids can’t read or write out a math problem, parents and teachers can start helping them draw those connections and give kids the tools to use in the near future in school.	<br><br>
Written communication is only one way mathematical and scientific concepts are articulated. “Exposure to oral mathematical language early in life enhances children’s vocabulary growth,” Mazzocco said, just as it does with reading. When kids explore cause-and-effect relationships or spatial reasoning, adults can merely observe and suggest the language for what the child had already discovered. “You’re providing the child with lots of language to explain principles they might not have overtly noticed,” Mazzocco said.	<br><br>
“It’s too much to expect for an infant to solve an algebra problem, of course, but they’re picking up a lot more than we give their credit for.”	<br><br>
A more general way that parents and teachers can foster a child’s interest in math and science is just by being careful of how they portray these topics to kids, even subtly. “We have to be very cognizant of the attitudes we convey about math and science,” Mazzocco said. “Kids pick up on that.” Adults who say that they’re bad at math or science around kids show that these are skills they do not value highly, showing kids that they shouldn’t value them, either.	<br><br>
So, how early is too early for adults to start teaching kids about math and science? “It’s never too early,” Mazzocco said. “The question is the mode of delivery as opposed to the content [of these lessons.]” It’s too much to expect for an infant to solve an algebra problem, of course, but children start absorbing a lot of information from their environments early on―and they’re picking up a lot more than we give their credit for, Mazzocco added. Giving them the right environments and presenting them with the right attitudes toward math and science could go a long way toward their future success.	<br><br>

童年时不曾纯真，青年时不曾燃烧，成年时不曾成熟。一拨拨人也就这样胡乱长大了<br><br>

押沙龙  文 电子工程师 <br><br>


我小学的时候，老师告诉我们要好好学习，以后成为国家的栋梁，做未来的主人翁。那时我们的班主任是个很胖的女人，除了让我们做国家的栋梁，她还有个爱好，就是打她的儿子。他当时也在我们班。她经常把他叫到讲台上，左手拿着他的试卷，右手劈脸一个嘴巴，把这位未来主人翁打得脸一歪，然后反手一抽，把他的脸再正回来。现在我还模糊记得那个孩子的样子，瘦瘦小小，一脸惊恐，像只走投无路的老鼠。<br><br>

我们虽然是“文革”后的一代，但毕竟也是读着魏巍的“美国鬼子脑浆迸裂，涂了一地，另一个战士，嘴里还衔着敌人的半块耳朵”课文长大的，神经比较大条，后来有老师指着学生骂“你离我远点，我看见你就恶心”，大家还会哄堂大笑。直到我长大后回想，才能体会到其中包含的残酷。当时我们也没有太多选择，要么哄堂大笑，要么噤若寒蝉。当然，噤若寒蝉多少体面一些。但我们毕竟是笑了。说起来，当年的我们就是这样，写着春光明媚的作文，读着正义感爆棚的课文，被委以祖国未来主人翁的重任，然后在成年人营造的诡异世界里寻求适应之道。图画与真实之间咫尺之地，窄仄到了只适合一个未来的犬儒存身。
<br><br>
那个年代很多老师和家长都脾气暴躁。时过境迁后，我能理解他们的心情。他们生活压力很大，什么东西都缺，而且从来没有人真正告诉过他们怎么教育孩子，怎么对待儿童。谁懂得这些事情呢？说到底，从来也没有人真正告诉他们怎么做一个成人。多少年来，大家都已习惯由别人替自己做决定。直到今天，还有很多专门针对老人的商家，做广告的时候不贴“商讯”而贴“通知”，就是捉摸明白了这种心理。而他们容易上野广告的当，很大程度上也是因为他们对任何媒体都有一种敬畏感。如果你告诉他们那些“王教授”是假的，他们的第一反应就是：要是假的，电台怎么可能让它播呢？<br><br>

把成人当作孩子，把孩子当作傻子，这样会让人丧失很多成长的机会。童年时不曾纯真，青年时不曾燃烧，成年时不曾成熟。一拨拨人也就这样胡乱长大了。善良和懦弱混迹不清，而秩序只能从恐惧和顺从中学来。当然，也有不小的进步，现在的成人多少比以前懂事点了，但在本质上，做事的方式还是差不多。就像崔健说的，大家骨子里究竟还是同一代人。我上学的时候，见过都二十多岁了还因为在校园角落里接吻，被保卫科撵鸡撵狗一样乱撵的大学生。就算现在，我也经常读到学生被校长抓来就剃头之类的新闻。从来没有被人真正尊重过的孩子，怎么能在长大后懂得尊重他人呢？他们是未来的主人翁。<br><br>

小时候的语文课里，小明是最让人讨厌的。他总是提前完成作业，总是帮助后进的同学。他一举一动都那么正义，正义到了你会盼着他哪天因为偷看女厕所被抓起来。马克 吐温就有篇恶搞的短篇小说，叫《好孩子的故事》，在故事里，小明谴责小刚不该爬树偷苹果，说作文里说了你这样的坏孩子会掉下来摔断胳膊的。结果小刚果真掉下来砸断了小明的胳膊，小刚却安然无事。故事的最后，马克 吐温心满意足地写道：小明因为干好事太多被活活炸死了。我们可不敢这么写。相反，我们在小明的带动下，在作文里做各种各样从没干过的好事，干好事前一定要想到雷锋邱少云黄继光他们，干好事后语文刘老师则总是“脸上露出欣慰的笑容”。另外我们还经常路过刘老师的家门口，看见她的窗口还亮着灯光，那是刘老师在批改我们作文，于是内心涌起一阵暖流。我们就是写这种东西长大的。然后等到这个社会上卖假酒卖假药，大家又叫着说：“人这都是怎么了？怎么都变得这么没有诚信？”这又是在装什么呢？
<br><br>
好莱坞的主流片子不管拍得多烂多假，宣传的价值观多老生常谈，但它们总能给人这样的感觉，就是导演确信观众认可这些价值。那种庸俗是温情甜腻的庸俗。而中国导演们想要“提一提境界”时候，却往往弄到笑场的地步。这不光是因为导演笨拙，也有一个原因是，我们这里确实缺少了某种东西。在这样的环境里，教养一个孩子，多少是件让人困惑的事。有位朋友抱怨过，把孩子送进学校以后，眼看着她很多地方都在变蠢，却毫无办法。我也曾经和女儿童童一起，站在水族馆前漫长的队伍里，看着有一家老小谈笑着径直走进了旁门，听着门口的保安对抗议者喊“那就是给领导进的，就是不给你家孩子进，怎么着？”再瞅着身边那些不解的孩子们，不免产生了罗大佑式的迷惘：“想起了遥远的过去未曾实现的梦，曾经一度人们告诉你说你是未来的主人翁。”

<br><br>

高晓松痛批奶茶妹妹前男友梁植：上节目纠结找工作 你愧对清华教育<br><br>
2014-11-13<br><br>

“学霸男神”最近很火，15分满分的“清华男神”（腰鼓队的）韩衍隽引发的网络“膜拜”热度还未消退，另一位“清华男神”梁植又因一段视频而走红网络。昨日（12日）有网友在网上曝光了高晓松和蔡康永加盟的《奇葩说》节目片段，奶茶妹妹章泽天前男友，同时也是被称为“清华男神”梁植的奇葩找工作言论，让高晓松在节目中首次动怒。<br><br>
节目中刚一亮相，梁植就说自己拥有法律、金融、新闻传播三项清华学历，但现在为毕业做什么而苦恼，希望三位导师支招。没想才说了1分钟，好脾气的蔡康永就直接按铃淘汰，理由是节目需要选手有自己的观点提问，而不是让梁植来找工作。随后梁植极力为自己辩解，解释从本科、硕士到博士，为什么会选择这三个专业，并表示是为了丰富自己的经历。此时一旁的高晓松已经听不下去，调侃称：“你就是北京话说的那种，我干什么成什么。我啥也没干，所以我啥也没成。”而且高晓松还善意提醒，如果梁植不亮出点新观点，自己也准备按铃淘汰。<br><br>
梁植在视频中如是说道：“本科学法律，是想学习形式辩护的技能，但后来一位好友的话提醒了我。他说你学法就好比是一名篮球赛的裁判，可你都没有打过篮球，有什么资格去当裁判？于是，我就开始学习经济学，想对国际贸易这块有更深的了解。当时硕士快毕业了，也面试了，不过参加了一个中央台的主持人比赛，又发现自己可能会在这项领域有更深入的尝试。于是博士读了新闻传播……”谁知梁植刚一讲完自己的履历，高晓松就不以为然：“那你觉得你朋友说的是对的么？那你现在读了金融，可没掌握实业，你是不是还会去读机械？读了机械，发现自己没接触电，是不是还要去读电这一块的专业？”蔡康永也附议道：“可你已经将这几个专业都读出来了，说明你本身也有实力。可你就会因为别人的几句话就赌上你人生的好几年，这点让我觉得很危险。”<br><br>
高晓松随即继续开启嘲讽模式：“我觉得你现在就是这样：你学了三个专业，好比一个姑娘说我身材又好，啥都好，你们觉得我该嫁谁？！”梁植此时明显感到自己受到了冒犯，无可辩驳却又连连摇头。<br><br>
但之后梁植始终没有办法跳脱这个话题，此时的高晓松已经按捺不住火气，火力全开炮轰。直言自己知道梁植是目前清华在校最优秀的学生之一，但对于一个名校生，对国家、社会没有一些自己的想法，反而纠结在工作，如此小的格局实在有失清华高材生的身份。高晓松甚至以一句重话对梁植全盘否定：“一个名校生走到这里来，问我们你该找什么工作？你觉得你愧不愧对清华十多年的教育？”<br><br>
在参加《奇葩说》之前，对于有“清华男神”称号的梁植来说，履历表几乎无懈可击。本科、硕士、博士全在清华就读；2011CCTV电视节目主持人大赛铜奖获得者；2013北京市大学生戏剧节最佳男演员奖获得者；清华的歌手赛第一名……绝对算是清华大学的风云人物。<br><br>
实际上梁植还有一个身份，就是网络红人奶茶妹妹的前男友。根据网友爆料，当时两人同为清华校友，而且还是奶茶妹妹倒追梁植，不过随着奶茶妹妹最终情定富商刘强东，这段恋情也无疾而终。在参加《奇葩说》之前，梁植还参加过北京卫视《我是演说家》，并且走到了最后一轮，是夺冠大热门，但此次在《奇葩说》惨遭滑铁卢。网友称梁植就是高智商低情商，“奶茶妹妹不要你是对的。”<br><br>
不过令人好奇的是，梁植此次上《奇葩说》的表现完全与之前《我是演说家》中的自己判若两人。10月11日播出的北京卫视《我是演说家》第二期节目中，清华博士生梁植因其帅气的外表、精彩的演讲让他成为场上的宠儿，四位导师都希望将这名强将收入囊中，也因此为他展开了《我是演说家》的首次抢人大战。<br><br>
梁植以两弹元勋邓稼先为主题，阐述了个人付出与国家成就的关系。在他的演讲中，观众感受到了一位科学工作者的奉献及伟大。网友“齐昱”在看完视频后也连连感叹：“对于这种的题材演讲，我本来是不太感兴趣的，但那天看到后半段的时候真的流泪了，这个社会情怀少了，但并不代表没有存在过，没想到我们离那个时代那么近，邓稼先消失28年研究两弹回来国家只给了他二十块奖金，他因工作得了直肠癌晚期，如果活到现在也只有九十岁……”<br><br>
精彩的演讲，让刘嘉玲很快选定了他。其他导师自然也不想错过这位学霸，纷纷向他伸出橄榄枝，希望将他收入自己的队伍中。作为X导师的鲁豫，虽然无缘争夺这位演说者，但她仍然象征性的按下了选择按钮，以示对梁植的赞赏。乐嘉也道出自己认为梁植演说中最打动人的地方是细节。因为用细节和事实来打动人最有力量。不过，乐嘉作为导师，也履行职责指出了梁植的不足，如台词的痕迹感过重及表现形式过于正统。由于乐嘉的点评正中梁植的内心，梁植毫不犹豫的选择了进入乐嘉战队，让其他几位导师只剩下羡慕嫉妒的份儿了。<br><br>

Under the leadership of Dean of the Faculty William C. Kirby, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) is in the midst of its first major review of the Harvard College curriculum since the mid-1970s. The report issued this spring offers a set of proposals that we believe will strengthen undergraduate education at Harvard and prepare students well for their post-college lives. Next year, the community will debate and refine the proposals and prepare to implement changes in the undergraduate curriculum.<br><br>
As we engage in this review, several questions come to mind. Is revision of the curriculum something that happens at Harvard only once every 30 years? Why is this the right time to undertake a major review? And, anticipating that our answer to the first question is no, to what degree does the recent report represent continuity or a discontinuous break with the past?<br><br>

The curriculum in Harvard College is renewed and energized on a regular basis. Faculty revise and update their courses to reflect the reframing of debates and advances in knowledge and to improve pedagogy. Departments develop new courses to reflect emerging areas of student and faculty interest. Departments and concentrations regularly re-evaluate and revise their curricula, changing requirements, restructuring course sequences and introducing new options for students.
<br><br>
Several years ago, for example, the two biology departments created a new course in genetics and genomics to serve as the gateway to concentration, introducing students early to the basic language of the life sciences. The English department revised its junior tutorial program two years ago to strengthen its intellectual content and to bring small groups of undergraduates together with one graduate student for each group to explore a topic of mutual interest, with emphasis on research and writing. With greater faculty strength and more courses in film studies, the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies will offer a new concentration track in this area next year. And last year, the Department of Afro-American Studies reconfigured itself as African and African American Studies, inaugurating an African languages program this year and a new concentration track in African studies for next year.<br><br>

The period since the 1997 review of the Core Program has been one of rapid change with respect to College-wide programs and degree requirements, as the Faculty has reviewed and modified particular aspects of the curriculum. <br><br>

The Faculty voted in 1997 to introduce Quantitative Reasoning as a new Core area, expanding the Core Program from 10 to 11 areas and the number of exemptions from 2 to 3. <br><br>

The Faculty also voted to allow department alternates to Core courses in the humanities and social science areas; these already existed in the science areas. The Core Standing Committee has focused on expanding the offerings in the Core proper, but 16 department courses in the humanities and social sciences now satisfy Core requirements.<br><br>

Language citations were introduced in 1999 to recognize and encourage sustained work in a foreign language. Today, 354 are being awarded in 18 languages. Students may use a language citation toward the Core Foreign Cultures requirement.<br><br>

The Faculty asked the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) to examine the overall number of requirements with an eye toward allowing more elective choices. The EPC focused on reducing the number of concentration requirements. One-third of the concentrations, including some of the largest, reduced requirements in at least one of their tracks.<br><br>

During the 2000-2001 academic year, the Faculty began an expansion of the Freshman Seminar Program to increase the opportunities for first-year students to benefit from small-group instruction. The program has expanded from 36 seminars offered that year to 114 to be offered next year. To open curricular space for students to enroll in seminars, the Faculty reduced the Core requirement from 8 to 7 of the 11 areas.<br><br>

Over the past two years, the Faculty has sought to make study abroad a more natural part of a Harvard College education, creating a new Office of International Programs and asking concentrations to facilitate a semester abroad. To lower one barrier to study abroad, the Core Standing Committee reduced the Core requirement by one area for each full term of study abroad. During the past year, 173 students studied abroad for one or both terms. This summer, 130 students will study abroad, including 35 enrolled in courses taught by Harvard faculty through the Summer School.<br><br>

So, why a major review of the undergraduate curriculum at this point in time? As University President Lawrence H. Summers often reminds us, no institution, no matter how strong, should go for more than 25 or 30 years without critical self-examination. Harvard must adapt to the profound changes in society. Moreover, the interconnected worlds of scholarship and teaching have changed significantly in many fields, and we must think collectively about what and how we teach, and for what purpose. The rapid rate of curricular innovation and change over the past several years far outpaces what we had seen during the period from the introduction of the Core in the 1970s until the 1997 review. This too is a sign that the time had come to step back from business as usual and take a comprehensive look at the curriculum to make certain that the various components provide a unified vision of what we seek to achieve in the education of Harvard College students.<br><br>

The recent report on the Harvard College Curricular Review reaffirms our commitment to a liberal education in the arts and sciences and outlines a curriculum in which students have greater freedom to shape their educations. While many of the recommendations represent new formats, opportunities and commitments, they bring together and recast many of the changes that were already being developed in the concentrations and in FAS at large: commitment to international education, growing emphasis on the sciences, opportunities for interdisciplinary work and more venues for students to work closely with faculty in small groups.<br><br>

If the changes outlined in the report are adopted, how might a student entering Harvard College a few years from now make her way through the curriculum? In consultation with an academic adviser, she will choose a freshman seminar or another small course that provides the opportunity to work closely with a faculty member. Another course will be devoted to advancing her skills in written and oral communication. She will also take foundational courses co-taught by faculty from FAS and perhaps from across the University that introduce her to important concepts and approaches from several fields. Her other courses freshman year and during the first term of sophomore year will allow her to explore areas of interest that will help her choose a concentration mid-way through the sophomore year. The wider range of choices available for meeting general education requirements eliminates the distinctions among general education, concentration and elective courses.
<br><br>
Once she has chosen a concentration―say, government with a special interest in international environmental policy―she will continue to work with an adviser to plan her academic program. She will take a junior seminar that focuses on a topic in international relations. She will also explore her interests in this area (and her secondary interest in Latin American literature) while studying for a term in Chile―and meet her language requirement by taking courses taught in Spanish during that term abroad. A smaller number of concentration requirements and greater flexibility to take related courses, as well as a larger number of electives, will allow her to support her interest in environmental issues by taking courses on the economics of the environment and science courses on climate change and environmental engineering (counting toward her physical science general education requirement). A January term might be used to travel to Costa Rica with a Harvard course on biodiversity. As a senior, she might enroll in a seminar on global warming, collaborating on a group project with classmates who are completing their concentrations in economics, history and science, biology and environmental science and public policy. And throughout her four years in the College, she will use electives to take a range of courses that allow her to pursue already-established interests and to develop new interests.
<br><br>
As Harvard College reinvents itself from generation to generation, it also continues a great tradition of providing outstanding education for undergraduates, adapting itself to changes in the world and in student and faculty interests, recognizing the great talent among both students and faculty and periodically taking stock to re-evaluate in a large way how well we are doing and how we might do better.

LIBERAL EDUCATION AT HARVARD
IN THIS NEW CENTURY<br><br>
Jorge I. Domínguez<br><br>
Clarence Dillon Professor of International Affairs
Department of Government<br><br>


Aliberal education is what remains after you have forgotten the facts that were
first learned while becoming educated. This view is especially comforting to professors
of a certain age who forget even where they place their glasses but, at Harvard, it has
long been influential. Harvard philosopher Alfred North Whitehead put it articulately in an essay
first published in 1922. The “really useful training,” Whitehead argued, focuses on “general principles.”<br><br>
One result is that “in subsequent practice the men will have forgotten your particular
details; but they will remember by an unconscious common sense how to apply principles to immediate
circumstances.”1<br><br>
This general view has been a foundation stone of the Harvard College curriculum since
President Charles William Eliot introduced the elective system to replace a curriculum of prescribed
courses. It is the often-unacknowledged foundation stone of the Core Curriculum, which
focuses on “approaches to knowledge” or “modes of thought.”2 It remains a sound basis on which
to construct the Harvard College curriculum today.<br><br>
In this essay, I focus only on that portion of a liberal education that can be called “general
education,” that is, the portion of an undergraduate’s time in College spent outside a major or
concentration but in some way constrained by some requirements (i.e., not pure electives). A curriculum
must be built on courses, and to these I turn first.

	<b><a name="T5">I. Four Criteria</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Harvard College liberal-education courses in a general education program ought to meet
four key criteria. The first is that they should foster discernment. Students in such courses should
perceive the aesthetic world of the arts and letters; apprehend fundamental ideas, methods, and
principles underlying the sciences; recognize and analyze distinctive aspects of social behavior in
our world and its past; and be capable of rendering acute judgments and making ethical decisions.
Discernment in our century cannot be limited to learning just about the United States or the North
Atlantic countries. Our students will live in a world of increasing cosmopolitan experiences and
interconnectedness.<br><br>

The second criterion is that these courses should develop creativity. Students should learn
to transcend traditional ideas, patterns, and relationships in order to fashion new ones thoughtfully.
Professors should encourage originality, exploration, and discovery within and across
scholarly disciplines, unafraid to present material that might even seem contradictory. To quote
Whitehead, the “justification for a university” requires the “imaginative consideration of learning.”
3<br><br>
Thirdly, such courses should construct and propel the communicative skills of our students.<br><br>
This notion is one of the key features of the penultimate comprehensive review of the College’s
curriculum in 1945, which sought to make our students capable “to communicate
thought.”4 For many disciplines in the physical, life, and behavioral sciences, “thought” is often
communicated most effectively through mathematics or statistics. For all disciplines, communication
characteristically requires the capacity to write and to speak with some eloquence. In many
instances, a language other than the one first learned is an essential to communicate in the cosmopolitan
world into whose membership our students should aspire.<br><br>
Finally, general-education courses should be accessible to undergraduates who approach
them with varying levels of preparation. The criterion of access leads many colleges to emphasize
survey courses. One way to read the one-phrase course labels of possibly new Harvard College
Courses that appear in A Report on the Harvard College Curricular Review (2004) is that many
will, indeed, be survey courses. But that is not, of course, the only way to make courses accessible
to undergraduates who have not studied a subject before. An alternative is to teach highly
specialized courses to beginners; the professor can do so, however, only if the course has been
designed to entice, inform, motivate, and empower the student to proceed expeditiously and
within one semester from ignorance to mastery. This may be what Whitehead may have meant by
his second “educational commandment,” namely, “What you teach, teach thoroughly.”5<br><br>
This approach to thinking about courses and the curriculum that follows from it has a
number of practical consequences. It makes it unlikely that a good design would be a simple
“distributional requirement” scheme that clumps courses into humanities, social sciences, life sciences,
and physical sciences. Yes, that is a common design throughout much of higher education
in the United States, and it has the advantage of simplicity. It disregards, however, the full dimensions
of the criterion of discernment. It takes no explicit steps to develop communicative skills. It
is at best agnostic on whether creativity would be fostered. It is virtually condemned to rely
exclusively on survey courses to meet the criterion of access. It leaves no obvious place for
courses to be developed outside disciplinary departments and thus makes curricular and
pedagogical innovation either less likely or merely ornamental. It would be better to adopt a more
focused system of specific requirements for students to develop better their mental faculties.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T6">II. The Curriculum as a Social Process</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
General education courses may spring unaided from the minds of professors, but it is
more likely that they would result as part of a process of collegial conversation. We, professors, should feel jointly responsible for the curriculum. Only through such collective ownership6 of the
curriculum will we hold each other accountable for our pedagogical actions. Joint curriculum
owners can step outside the logical consequence of their research work, which takes them
naturally to prefer to teach graduate students. Joint curriculum owners are more likely to be
interested in exploring and developing the potential of a liberal education than simply
emphasizing the narrower specialization that takes place, quite properly, in the concentrations or
majors.<br><br>
Joint curriculum ownership is part of Harvard’s own history during its two most recent
curricular reorganizations. The respective births of General Education and the Core Curriculum
resulted from the active collective work of the faculty at the time to generate new courses. The
founders believed in the principle of joint ownership but they also found it practical. Professors
produce such courses in sufficient numbers―presumably enough so that not all can meet only in
Sanders Theater―as a result of recruitment, encouragement, discussion, and experimentation.
There must be a professor (or a small teaching team) to launch and teach the course, but the construction
of a curriculum, not just individual star attractions, is characteristically a social process
that requires committees or task forces.<br><br>
Curricular committees charged with the development of general education should not be
entrusted to professors from a single discipline. If so, the members of a committee constituted
exclusively from a single discipline would generate courses not unlike those in their home
department. Each curricular committee charged with developing or overseeing some fraction of a
general education program must continuously ask: “What about your subject should my student
learn?” The courses in general education must respond to the shared goals of the faculty, not just
to the personal whims of a professor.<br><br>
Curricular committees with members from various disciplines are more likely than disciplinary
committees, or departments under a system of “distributional requirements,” to take seriously
the intellectual and practical interests of non-concentrators. How must a general education
history course be designed to be accessible to a physicist? What pedagogical approaches, style of
teaching, or structure and pacing of course assignments would most likely motivate a physicist to
learn what is taught in such a history course―and to do well? This social process is the most
effective way to ensure that general education courses meet the criterion of access because professors
will be compelled to respond to the question, “What will make it possible for my student
to do well in your course?”<br><br>
This collective process is likely to lead to general education courses that emphasize
learning about general principles, intellectual frameworks, and criteria of assessment as means of
discernment. Some courses may be surveys, but even such courses are less likely to be burdened
with minutiae than departmental courses might be. This group endeavor would most likely meet
the common-sense standard about a course: it really belongs in the general education curriculum.
Professors from other disciplines would constitute, in effect, a “focus” group.<br><br>
Curricular committees whose members are drawn from different departments are also
more likely to encourage general education courses that transcend the discipline of origin in order
to foster and develop a more experimental and innovative creativity. Intellectual conversations
between committee members, and between them and the professor, raise interdisciplinary issues
readily. Moreover, team-taught interdisciplinary courses may emerge more easily in this fashion.
<br><br>
Committees are also more likely than professors acting alone to pay attention to that
aspect of a general education course that would develop communicative skills, such as writing,
speaking, or computation and formal mathematical presentations. For this purpose, too, a committee
composed of members of various disciplines is helpful, though less essential. Ultimately,
the committee should also ask, “What will my student communicate to me about the learning in
your course?”<br><br>
Finally, such a social process is more likely to provide effective monitoring. Professors
from various departments are more likely to remind each other of the propriety and utility of
ensuring that the promises made at the time of general education course approval are in fact
carried out. Collective curriculum construction and monitoring is a social contract that should
endure both before and after the unveiling of the courses.<br><br>
These courses designed principally for non-concentrators are often difficult to teach, no
matter how talented the professor or professorial team may be. The College must commit substantial
pedagogical resources to make it possible to teach such courses successfully. For some
courses, this may well require a substantial teaching or technical staff. For others, it may be the
development of complex web pages or the acquisition of materials and other appropriate audiovisual
support. For all, it requires better-designed and equipped classrooms than the current ofteninadequate
physical spaces where so much Harvard College instruction currently takes place.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T7">III. Practical Implications</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
I am not unaware that the preceding paragraphs make a case on behalf of the current
Harvard College Core Curriculum. This Core Curriculum is superior to the alternative it replaced
and to the sketches that have been suggested thus far to replace it. Suppose, however, that the expression
“core curriculum” must be expunged from the future of Harvard College. What, then,
might be salvaged?<br><br>
Some version of the long-existing Core Curriculum committee would be worth preserving.
It would perform the collegial tasks that are likely to generate first-rate, accessible Harvard
College Courses truly accessible to non-concentrators. It would seek to ensure that such new
Harvard College Courses make it possible for undergraduates to explore different forms of discernment
beyond those commonly found in departments. It would pay attention to the particulars
of requirements in each such course to increase the likelihood that communicative skills were
being taught. And it would monitor.<br><br>
Assume that some version of distributional requirements replaces the Core Curriculum. A
weak but still useful mandate for the committee that succeeds the Core committee would be to
facilitate advice to undergraduates. The committee would be empowered to award an asterisk to
departmental courses that voluntarily submit to its scrutiny. The asterisk would signal to undergraduates
and their advisers that such courses do a superior job of exposing non-concentrators to
forms of discernment in creative ways, teaching communicative skills, and in a manner accessible
to non-concentrators. Students could enroll, however, in any course within the clusters approved
by the distributional requirements, asterisk or no asterisk.<br><br>
A stronger version of the mandate would lay between the old Core Curriculum and a
system of distributional requirements. The new committee would generate and oversee a few
Harvard College Courses. It would work with every department to identify which course meets
the broad criteria for general education, to be elaborated in greater detail. These courses would be awarded asterisks, and only they would meet the criteria of distributional requirements. This
would differ from the Core Curriculum because the new committee’s task would be to work with
departments. The rules would be simpler than under the Core Curriculum. The number of asterisked
courses would likely be much larger than with the Core Curriculum. It would differ from
distributional requirements because the committee would look carefully within each course to
ensure that criteria of access, communicative skill, and general pertinence to non-concentrators
are met.<br><br>
The practical question might be posed differently. What is it about the sketch regarding
general education provided in A Report on the Harvard College Curricular Review in spring 2004
that differs most from the Core Curriculum? There are three changes. First, the Report increases
general education requirements in comparison with the Core Curriculum, as it currently exists.
Second, the Report implies a shift to a distributional requirement with four clusters. Third, the
principal disciplinary difference between the Core Curriculum and the suggested distributional
requirement is that the latter emphasizes the natural sciences at the expense of the humanities in
the former.<br><br>
The first of these changes is probably undesirable if one agrees with the general thrust of
other parts of the Report about freeing our students from too many burdens. Previous paragraphs
have indicated why distributional requirements, though common, may be inferior to the Core
Curriculum. Could the third objective be achieved without overturning the Core Curriculum to
save its strengths but tilt more toward the life and physical sciences?<br><br>
It would be easy to implement a change within the Core Curriculum requirements to tilt
toward the natural sciences. Combine Literature and Arts A & C and Historical Studies A & B;
undergraduates henceforth could fulfill the respective literature or history requirements with a
single course each. Those courses would still be of the two types that exist in the Core, thereby
retaining and widening student choice within the Core. Allocate the courses thus released to the
natural sciences. The allocation could be somewhat mechanical―one for the life sciences,
another for the physical sciences―or fashioned in some other way that would be more hospitable
to those interested in, say, biophysics. The reform could be more modest; for example, only Literature
and Arts A & C would be combined but not the two in Historical Studies, thereby increasing
the science content in the Core Curriculum by one rather than two half-courses. (Staffing
constraints for basic science courses for non-concentrators may call for a more modest reform, for
instance.)<br><br>
With such a modest reform of the Core Curriculum, the effect would be that students in
the humanities would spend most of their Core Curriculum time enrolled in science courses, and
most students in the life and physical sciences would study literature, history, and the social sciences
in the Core Curriculum. It is not yet too late to embrace this approach to reform.

	<b><a name="T8">IV. A Note on Internationalization of the General Education Curriculum</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The existing Core Curriculum is stunningly cosmopolitan. It is not just the courses in the
Foreign Cultures wing that address issues beyond the United States. So, too, do many courses in
Literature & Arts, Historical Studies, Social Analysis, and Moral Reasoning. It would be difficult
to envisage a strategy that would lead to a more internationalized Core Curriculum overall. A
shift toward the natural sciences would reduce the explicit international content of the general education requirement. Science is inherently transnational but it does not teach much about other
parts of the world. A distributional requirement would reflect the international content of the curriculum
as a whole, which may be lower than in the current Core Curriculum.<br><br>
A science “tilt” to general education may be complemented with a requirement for an
international experience, as A Report on the Harvard College Curricular Review indicates. The
burden of the new requirement would fall mainly on science students who may find their ability
to pursue the same line of study more difficult in other countries. It may be preferable to facilitate,
encourage, and promote international experiences, but without requiring them, in order to
comply with the larger mandate of the Report, namely, that we make it possible for our students
to exercise wider freedom and choice within the Harvard College curriculum.<br><br>

Dean<br><br>
January 20, 2006<br><br>
Dear Colleagues:
As you well know, three years ago our Faculty began a comprehensive review of the
undergraduate educational experience at Harvard College. In April 2004 the Report on the Harvard
College Curricular Review was issued, laying out a series of fundamental recommendations. Over the
last year and a half, a further sequence of committees, comprised of faculty and students, have met to
review more closely the heart of what we do here.<br><br>
These reports are all now ready for the Faculty’s deliberation. Please take the time to read them
carefully. They are the collective work of more than one hundred of your colleagues and two dozen of
our students. They have been discussed in Faculty Meetings and in other settings, and several of them
have been revised in the light of comments from you and your colleagues. In all, nearly sixty final
recommendations will have been made to the Faculty. They cover many fronts, but they share in
common a guiding principle of the April 2004 Report:1<br><br>
[W]e seek to broaden the scope of a liberal education and to expand choices for Harvard College
students, crafting an undergraduate curriculum that is defined less by the requirements that it
places on students and more by the commitments that the Faculty makes to undergraduate
education in the liberal tradition.<br><br>
Let me comment briefly on the individual reports before returning to the larger picture. The
Committee on General Education proposes to replace the Core Program with a curriculum at once broad
and deep, opening up the entire Courses of Instruction for the general education of our students,
empowering departments to craft curricula for broader audiences, while summoning the Faculty to mount
a new set of foundational courses to serve as portals to large and important areas of knowledge.<br><br>
The Educational Policy Committee has reviewed the purpose, structure, timing and scope of
concentrations. Its several recommendations―for example, of later concentration choice and the creation
of secondary fields―aim to make the Freshman year a time of true exploration, the upper-class
experience one of multiple immersions, and all four years ones of meaningful student-faculty
engagement.<br><br>



The Committee on Writing and Speaking argues that the teaching of writing and speaking must be
newly integrated into departments and degree programs. It calls for a major reorganization and renewal
of our efforts in those domains. The Committee on Science and Technology has recommended a new set of introductory courses in the natural and applied sciences, the first fruit of which debuted this autumn, to
considerable praise: Life Sciences 1a and 1b. The Committee on Advising and Counseling addresses, in
the most comprehensive report this Faculty has ever produced on the topic, our severe deficiencies in
academic advising and suggests multiple paths to improvement, in the knowledge that greater freedom of
choice only underscores the need for strong mentoring and advising.<br><br>
The Committee on Education Abroad recommends that all Harvard College students pursue a
significant international experience during their time in the College. Working with our Office for
International Programs it has overseen a broad expansion of our programs abroad and has proposed
standards for the forms of international study, research, internship and public service opportunities that
would meet this expectation. The Committee on Pedagogical Improvement tells us how we can evaluate
better teaching and learning across the College and how, as an undergraduate college at the center of a
research university, we might further the development of communities of learning. And the Committee
on a January Term imagines how, in the event of a change in calendar, this dark and cold month, in
which our students currently pass weeks of unstructured time culminating in final examinations, might
instead be a time of imagination and innovation.<br><br>




What are the common principles underlying all these efforts? There are several, and they are
important. From the beginning of this review, our most important aim has been to re-commit our Faculty
to the central task of educating undergraduates. As Harvard grew into a major research university over
the course of the past century, faculty time and energy has naturally been drawn also to graduate
education and to professional activities beyond the Yard. Yet Harvard College remains at the heart of our
enterprise, attracting the best students in the world, setting standards for excellence across and beyond the
University. We take pride in the fact that so many colleagues and students have taken part in the Working
Groups of our first year and the review committees of the past eighteen months; that faculty and students
alike have produced substantial essays on education at Harvard;2 and that every department and
concentration is now discussing curricular renewal.<br><br>


Ours is a recommitment to liberal education. “Among the liberal arts,” wrote Montaigne, “let us
begin with the art that liberates us.”3 Montaigne was referring to a process whereby previously
unexplored beliefs and values are challenged as well as unsuspected dimensions of the self discovered
and nurtured in order that students may become “wiser and better” for themselves and for society. Liberal
education presumes that a broad education will liberate the individual by offering opportunities for
foundational knowledge, reflection and analysis, artistic creativity and an appreciation for the precision of
scientific concepts and experiments. It stresses Bildung over Ubung(德语), emphasizing disinterested
knowledge for its own sake, resisting pressures for early specialization and professionalization.<br><br>




Professional education is in the proud tradition of many great universities, but it is not the mission of our
undergraduate college. Our students will devote some significant part of their time to special and
concentrated learning, but we aspire above all that they graduate having developed their intellectual,
artistic, moral, and civic capacities as independent thinkers with a lifetime of learning still before them.<br><br>
That is what we mean when we welcome our graduates to the “fellowship of educated women and men.”
Our students will enter a globalizing world of national conflicts, of scientific advance and moral
challenge, of political choice and economic uncertainty, of artistic imagination and cultural repression.<br><br>
There is no “one-size-fits-all” educational menu for such alternative futures, nor would one be appropriate
for the enormously diverse talents that comprise the student body at Harvard College. Thus, while there 



are of course many curricular routes to liberal education, the one proposed in these reports sets out a
curriculum of choice, incentive, and opportunity more than one of restriction and requirement. It aims to
allow our students to shape their education, even as it gives departments and individual faculty greater
responsibility in helping to shape it. It permits our curriculum to evolve, as areas of knowledge advance.<br><br>
Required courses have captive audiences, and, as we have seen in our previous curricular
reforms, short intellectual half-lives. If our new, foundational curriculum in the life, physical, and
engineering sciences is to succeed, let it be because it is better conceived and better taught, not because
any one part of it is compulsory. If new Courses in General Education are to make their mark in the
lineage of great Harvard courses, let it be because they are great courses, not because they are mandated.<br><br>
If, as we expect, the study of the broader world and the languages spoken in it continues to expand, let
this be not because of enlarged requirements (for true fluency no requirement could be large enough) but
as a result of a new set of opportunities at home and abroad that will make every Harvard undergraduate
degree one with a deeply international imprint.<br><br>
The reforms proposed in our reports make it clear that a liberal education must be the shared
endeavor of faculty and students alike. It is an education fostered not only in classrooms and laboratories
but also by individual conversation and advising. Students and faculty must truly engage one another,
close up, and not at a distance. The most consistent―and most accurate―criticism of a Harvard
education today is that student-faculty contact is much too limited. Our current system of concentrations
decants too many students, much too early, into too few concentrations that are too large. Our Core
Program funnels too many students into too few courses that are on the whole too big. To be sure, large
concentrations and big courses can be of outstanding quality―that is presumably one reason for their
popularity; but in both concentrations and our current Core, our academic culture is too often one of
mutual avoidance between student and professor. Taken together, our expansion of the Faculty, the
growth of Freshman seminars, the opening up of general education, the delay in the timing of
Concentration choice, and the proposal for secondary fields all have behind them the purpose of bringing
our students and faculty together in intensive, inescapable ways, making it possible―indeed making it
expected―that students and faculty can engage in small groups settings from the beginning of the
Freshman year, and as the rule, not as the exception. After all, if we bring to Cambridge (we know) the
best students and (we trust) the best faculty, should they not engage with each other, and learn from each
other, rather more directly than they do? I am convinced that only if we succeed in this effort can we
hope to contest the view that the better part of a Harvard education lies outside the classroom.<br><br>
The history of our curricular reforms in the past century shows that Harvard has been better at
making large curricular statements than it has been in improving the teaching of its undergraduates. We
should be pleased for this Faculty to engage in a firm defense of the ideals of liberal education―
vulnerable here as anywhere―but only if, in the same moment, we really improve what we do here. We
should aspire that Harvard College prove itself to be the equal in teaching, mentoring, and inspiration to
any of the great small liberal arts colleges in the American tradition, while setting itself apart by virtue of
its position at the heart of a large and international research university.<br><br>
This broad scrutiny of our collective teaching endeavor is now in its third year. The time has
come to move forward with our formal deliberations and toward the legislation that we think appropriate
in the light of the recommendations these reports incorporate. In the coming semester we will set before
the Faculty the recommendations first on concentrations and then on general education. We will hear
further on the recommendations on writing and speaking. We will bear in mind the implications of all of
these for the recommendations on advising, which colleagues have already received. If, after we have
discussed the broad outline of curricular change, the planets remain in alignment, we can then revisit the
question of when we teach, that is, the matter of our academic calendar.
<br><br>

As we move from a time of consultation and recommendation to a term of formal discussion and
decision, we should bear in mind how much we have accomplished already. We have made great
progress in the expansion of the Faculty that I announced in the letter transmitting the April 2004 Report.<br><br>
A larger Faculty is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the improvement of undergraduate
education. To foster small-group instruction, we have further expanded the Freshman Seminar Program
to offer enough seminars to accommodate the entire freshman class. To give our students an education in
the broader world in which they will work, we have expanded swiftly the opportunities and assistance for
international study so that already today more than half of our students pursue a significant international
experience before graduation. To promote a deeper level of scientific literacy, we are not only planning,
but we have also begun to teach parts of a fundamentally new science curriculum, the first of our “portal”
courses. To mentor and support our students more effectively, we are overhauling completely the
structures of academic advising in the College. And of course we have continued to talk, argue, and
engage with one another, ever more deeply, about the importance of undergraduate education.
I look forward to our continued discussion and our continued progress.

	<hr><br>
	
<a href= "link06.html">是那些人主宰美国</a><br><br>
I. From the Report of the Standing Committee
on Advising and Counseling<br><br>
1. We recognize the critical role and importance of advising. Advising is an intrinsic and important
part of the academic mission of the College, and needs to be improved. We believe that more
engagement in advising, particularly by faculty, is essential to the success of any curricular
innovations.<br><br>
2. We recommend that all faculty participate in some way in undergraduate advising.<br><br>
3. We endorse enthusiastically the establishment of a new dean of advising position in the College
and have recommendations concerning role and function. We also recommend that an advisory
board be established to assist the new dean. We prefer the title “Associate Dean of Advising
Programs” to reflect the full scope of the position.<br><br>
4. The new Office of Advising will need adequate staff support, space, and resources. Some of the
recommended functions of the Advising Office can be listed as follows:<br><br>
a. Improving the consistency and coordination of Freshman, House, and Concentration advising
utilizing the Advising Calendar (see below);<br><br>
b. Working with the Freshman Deans, Concentration and House advisers, the Office of Career
Services, Bureau of Study Counsel, and Office of International Programs to organize, expand
and improve the effectiveness of workshops and panel discussions for students prior to
concentration choice;<br><br>
c. Improving the quality, consistency, and comparability of written and electronic information,
particularly from concentrations;<br><br>
d. Improving adviser training programs in collaboration with the Freshman Deans,
Concentration and House advisers, the Office of Career Services, Bureau of Study Counsel,
and Office of International Programs;<br><br>
e. Serving as “prompter” for advisers and advisees, for example through developing simple
reminders about important topics for advising conversations that can be sent to advisers and
advisees at appropriate times;<br><br>
f. Developing tools to evaluate and assess advisers and advising systems, with a view to sharing
best practices;<br><br>
g. As soon as possible, developing an Annual Report to the Faculty on the quality of our
advising programs; and<br><br>

h. The Committee recommends that it be reconstituted, perhaps as a smaller group, as an
Advisory Board to the Office of Advising.<br><br>
5. We recommend recruiting more academic advisers (faculty or administrators) for freshmen.
These advisers would serve through the three terms prior to concentration choice.<br><br>
6. We have drafted an advising calendar to clarify advising tasks and responsibilities for both
advisers and students, for both pre-concentration and concentration periods.<br><br>
7. Concentrations should engage more vigorously in developing advising programs for preconcentrators.
8. Concentrations should ensure that every student has an identifiable concentration adviser.<br><br>
9. We recommend ongoing evaluation of advisers and monitoring of advising programs, and the use
of collected data to determine best practices in advising.<br><br>
10. We recommend no change in freshmen assignment to Houses.<br><br>
11. We recommend that the number of Assistant Deans of Freshmen be increased from 3 to 4,
bringing the ratio of advisees to Assistant Dean close to the ratio of advisees to Senior Tutor in
the Houses.<br><br>
12. We recommend that every effort be made to increase the overall number of academic advisers,
thereby reducing the maximum number of academic advisees per Proctor to a reasonable number.<br><br>
For example, we believe that the number of suitable and recruitable faculty is certainly higher
than 39. The serious involvement of our Faculty leaders will be critical to successful expansion
of this number.<br><br>
13. We recommend establishing a comprehensive peer advising system covering all first-years, with
a formal program name and adviser title to be approved at a later time. We recommend that
every incoming student be assigned a specific peer adviser and be contacted and welcomed by
that adviser before arrival on campus.<br><br>
14. We also recommend the extension, organizational reform, greater support, and diversification of
the several existing pre-orientation programs, such as the Freshman Outdoor Program (FOP), the
Freshman Arts Program (FAP), and Freshman Urban Program (FUP).<br><br>
15. We recommend therefore that the Dean of the College convene a series of meetings with the
larger concentrations in which the dean of advising would be involved, to discuss ways of
improving advising.<br><br>
16. Success in improving our advising systems will depend to a considerable extent on strong and
sustained leadership from the Dean of the College, Dean of the Faculty, and President, and we
endorse and encourage their involvement.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T12">LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS II</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
II. From the Educational Policy Committee<br><br>
Summary Statement on Concentrations<br><br>
17. It is the view of the Educational Policy Committee (EPC) that delaying the timing of
concentration choice by one semester, to late in the third term, will provide more flexibility for
first-year students, create more time for intellectual exploration, and reduce some of the pressures
that may make adjustment to college more difficult than necessary.<br><br>
18. The EPC proposes that concentrations re-examine the number of courses they require, to ensure
that their requirements can fit within a five-semester program, rather than a six-semester program.
For many concentrations, this will require a reduction in the number of required courses.<br><br>
19. The EPC proposes that all concentrations re-examine and, when needed, restructure their
programs to ensure that there is appropriate sequencing and progression of courses for students’
effective learning and intellectual development.<br><br>
20. The EPC proposes the establishment of formal structures to provide guidance and coherence to
elective coursework in an area that lies outside the purview of a student’s primary concentration.<br><br>
The EPC has named this option a “secondary field,” and suggests that this optional course of
study be noted on a student’s transcript.<br><br>
21. The EPC also proposes to change the existing structures of joint concentrations. The EPC
recommends that students declaring a secondary field have the option of pursuing an integrative
thesis that combines the primary concentration and a secondary interest, but that this should not
be considered to be a joint concentration.<br><br>
22. As part of the overall curricular review, all concentrations should undertake a renewed
examination of their own purpose and structure.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS III</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
III. From the Report of the Committee on General Education<br><br>
23. The Committee recommends that the current Core Curriculum be replaced by a distribution
requirement consisting of nine courses, three in each of (a) the Arts and Humanities, (b) the Study
of Societies, and (c) Science and Technology. We further recommend that the three courses used
to fulfill an area distribution may not be taken in one department or program.<br><br>
24. We expect that each department will be responsible for identifying existing courses and
developing new ones that are especially well-suited for the goals and purposes of general
education.<br><br>
25. The Committee believes that the curriculum should assist students in shaping their education by
providing discrete opportunities for more intensive, foundational courses in general education.<br><br>
26. The Committee believes that we must highlight the importance of broad, synoptic courses that
reach beyond the scope of individual departments and disciplines as an integral, but optional,
component of a distribution requirement. We recommend the creation of new “Courses in
General Education,” that are expansive in scope and integrative in approach, and which will be listed in a separate section of the catalogue. These courses should be designed specifically to
situate important texts, concepts, and discoveries in the context of larger problems and themes in
ways that provide students with an intellectual introduction to broad areas of knowledge and
inquiry.<br><br>
27. The Committee reaffirms Harvard’s long-standing requirement that students complete a course
dedicated to effective writing in the first year. We also support the current requirement that all
students demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language. However, in order to provide first-year
students with more flexibility, we will no longer expect that the language requirement be met in
the freshman year. Rather, we recommend that the language requirement be fulfilled by the end
of the second year. Further, we believe that all Harvard College students should be expected to
participate in a significant international experience.<br><br>
28. The Committee recommends the formation of a new Standing Committee on General Education,
which will work with departments and with the deans to identify and to help develop departmental
courses suitable for general education, and to review and approve proposed Courses in
General Education.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T14">LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS IV</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
IV. From the Report of the Committee on Education Abroad<br><br>
29. The Committee endorses the recommendation of the report on the Harvard College Curricular
Review that all Harvard College students should henceforth be expected to pursue a significant
international experience during their time in the College, and that completion of such an
expectation be noted on the transcript. The Committee believes that students should be able to
fulfill this expectation through study abroad for credit as well as through research, internships, or
service and will propose appropriate standards to the Dean of the Faculty in due course.<br><br>
30. The Committee believes that the programs and activities developed for Harvard students and for
which Harvard students receive recognition should reflect Harvard’s institutional commitment to
understanding of and respect for the cultures and values of other societies and for different
educational objectives and pedagogies; focus on academic quality and opportunities to build
knowledge and skills while immersing students as far as possible in the host society to help them
develop sensitivity to the cultural environment and tolerance of the unfamiliar; and ensure that
financial constraints do not prevent access to every kind of opportunity to all our students.<br><br>
31. The Committee endorses the recommendation in the report of the Curricular Review that the FAS
expand financial aid for undergraduates to include summer grants and loans in order to make it
possible for all students to pursue at least one international experience. The Committee
recommends that future Harvard financial aid packages include financial aid in the form of
reduced summer earnings expectations as well as direct aid for students who do not study abroad
during the regular academic year but choose instead to spend a summer abroad in an approved
program of summer study, research, internship, or service. The Committee recommends that
financial aid only be given to students engaged in summer programs of sufficient seriousness as
to qualify for mention on the transcript.<br><br>
32. The Committee recommends increased merit-based support for summer activities through the
area and international centers as well as other Harvard programs.<br><br>

33. The Committee believes additional efforts should be made to insure that the range of summer
opportunities and levels of aid in relation to cost are roughly comparable across all world regions.<br><br>
34. The Committee also recognizes and applauds the importance of the language citation to our
students, and recommends that, in order to facilitate study abroad as a way of fulfilling part of the
four-course requirement for a citation that procedures be developed for pre-approving specific
programs or courses abroad for citation credit. The Committee further recommends that the
College provide encouragement to students’ engaged in rigorous interdisciplinary study of other
societies and cultures through official recognition of area studies certificates, beginning with the
Certificate in Latin American Studies that has been awarded to undergraduates by the FAS
Standing Committee on Latin American and Iberian Studies since 1967. Official recognition
would make it possible to mention this Certificate in official FAS publications, such as Courses
of Instruction, and on student transcripts.<br><br>
35. The number of course-based field trips, some supported by departments and centers, has also
increased in recent years. Should the calendar reform free up time in January, whether a formal
January-term is instituted or not, the Committee recommends that faculty be encouraged to
develop January study abroad activities, especially where such programs can be linked as follow
up to fall term courses or as introductions to spring term courses.<br><br>
36. We recommend that the FAS support the development of new programs and activities through the
creation of a special Innovation Fund to which faculty could apply. Funds would be allocated
competitively by the Committee on Education Abroad.<br><br>
37. The Curricular Review report recommended that the concentrations, in consultation with the
Office of International Programs, identify study abroad programs in which Harvard College
students may enroll for degree and concentration credit, and that all concentrations plan
requirements and course sequences to accommodate one term of study abroad. This Committee
endorses this recommendation.<br><br>
38. The Committee recommends that all concentrations have designated advisers for study abroad,
either a member of the faculty, or a member of the advising staff. Information and assistance for
these advisers should, of course, be provided by OIP, and OIP should continue to serve as
students’ primary source of advising on study abroad.<br><br>
39. The Committee believes that special attention should be paid to enhancing international opportunities
for science concentrators to engage in laboratory and fieldwork abroad. Such experiences
can make invaluable contributions to enriching a student’s program by integrating a student into
the scientific community of another society and by providing high-level engagement in basic or
applied research activity not available elsewhere in addition to the other benefits of studying
abroad. The Committee recommends that support be provided for the development, in consultation
with the faculty, of such opportunities for concentrators in all fields, but with special
attention given to developing programs for science concentrators in laboratories, field stations,
and other sites in as many regions of the world as may prove feasible.<br><br>
40. The Committee believes that Harvard alumni and their contacts throughout the world could play
an invaluable role in connecting students to worthwhile endeavors and recommends that the OIP
continue its efforts to work with other divisions at Harvard to develop a range of such
opportunities, using existing networks and knowledge of the extended Harvard community
whenever possible. Students can be guided towards these opportunities early in their time at Harvard, when such experiences are formative and can thus lay the foundation for future
international activity.<br><br>
41. Since the Houses are a critical source of information and advice on all aspects of undergraduate
life, the Committee recommends that every House designate a staff member to serve as resource
person for study abroad and international opportunities. The study abroad resource person in
each House would help to provide guidance on how to access information and refer students to
the Office of International Programs, the regional studies centers, and the Office of Career
Services for further help.<br><br>
42. The Committee encourages initiatives within the concentrations as well as the Houses to engage
returning students in analysis and reflection on their experience abroad, so that the impact of their
experience is maximized.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T16">LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS VI</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
VI. From the Report of the Standing Committee
on Pedagogical Improvement<br><br>
44. The College needs to improve evaluation of teaching and learning.<br><br>
45. We urge the undergraduate deans to consult with assessment experts and with focus groups that
include students, faculty, and graduate assistants to:<br><br>
a. refine the standard questions for clarity and relevance;<br><br>
b. offer a menu of optional questions from which instructors may choose;<br><br>
c. provide easier ways of breaking down the data so faculty can know what is and is not
working with particular groups; and<br><br>
d. provide opportunities for faculty a well as teaching fellows to discuss results with specialists
at the Bok Center.<br><br>
46. We want to emphasize the importance of interpretation and analysis. We not only need better
instruments for evaluating teaching but more help in assessing the data that we gather.
Quantitative information is only one part of the process. With on-line evaluations, students will
be able to include more comments. But if these are to be effective both students and instructors
need to know how to use them.<br><br>
47. The FAS needs to make existing support resources more visible and accessible to students,
teaching fellows, and faculty. We urge the administration to consider these improvements:
a. address the broader problem of competition and overlap among existing programs and
identify ways that the constituencies they serve might become more aware of what they have
to offer;<br><br>
b. establish an intranet for easy searching;<br><br>
c. expand the program begun this fall to orient junior faculty;<br><br>
d. give one person in each department or program responsibility for coordinating teaching
resources and training teaching fellows. The recently created Lead Teaching Fellows
program has been very helpful in some departments and might be a model for how to
proceed; and<br><br>
e. build service to faculty and students into every expansion in computer services. Even more
than software and power, people need well-trained individuals who can help them make use
of the available resources.<br><br>
48. The FAS needs to do more to develop communities of learning by:<br><br>
a. the establishment of a component of freshmen orientation that engages students from their
first days at Harvard in the problem of how people learn;<br><br>

b. the early development of several specific course proposals in general education that include
librarians, museum curators, and specialists from the appropriate instructional centers (Bok
Center, Writing Center, Instructional Computing Group, et al.) as part of the design team;<br><br>
c. the development of an advising tool that will allow students and advisers to group courses
around a theme or topic. We suspect that developing synergy in individual student programs
might be more effective in the long run than launching a large number of co-taught courses.<br><br>
This system might or might not include some sort of integrative seminar; and
d. the provision of easier, more flexible ways of administering anonymous mid-term evaluations
that will allow instructors and students to make mid-course corrections.<br><br>
49. Encourage innovation:<br><br>
a. find ways to open up the schedule to make it easier for classes to be offered in different
formats, such as hour and a half sessions that allow lectures to flow into discussion;<br><br>
b. link classroom planning to curriculum revision to provide better-equipped and more learningfriendly
classrooms;<br><br>
c. encourage open sharing of course materials not only to make better use of resources but to
deepen understanding of curricular options and approaches; and<br><br>
d. launch a series of seminars or workshops for faculty and teaching fellows on specific
practical problems in teaching (such as designing and grading exams) where people can learn
about new and better ways of doing things. This should not only be a forum where
instructors can share ideas but where they can learn from research on best practices.<br><br>

VII. From the Report of the Committee on Science
and Technology Education<br><br>
50. We recommend the development of introductory science courses in the life and physical science
divisions that demonstrate the connections between distinct fields and disciplines, and to generate
real enthusiasm for the study of modern science. Undergraduates will be exposed to a broader
range of science early on, which will allow them to make more informed choices about where
their academic interests may lie.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T18">LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS VIII</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
VIII. From the Report of the Committee on the Teaching
of Writing and Speaking in Harvard College<br><br>
51. We recommend strongly that the College entirely regroup and coordinate the efforts of
Expository Writing, the Harvard Writing Project (including Gordon Gray grants), individual
departments, the Bok Center (Graduate Writing Fellows), the Writing Center (peer tutoring), and
writing instruction offered by the Bureau of Study Counsel. Faculty in the Freshman Seminar
program may also wish to participate in this coordination. The result of such coordination would be a genuine center for all the functions these various entities now perform. This might be called
the Keller-Adams Program in Writing and Speaking (KAP).<br><br>
52. A required one-term course in academic writing should be taken the first year. We propose to
call this not Expository Writing but the Freshman Writing Tutorial. We suggest that, while its
assignments remain traditionally graded and while the College maintain and report to the student
a record of the letter grade earned for the course, the transcript itself indicate Sat/Unsat and the
student GPA be calculated without the letter grade.<br><br>
53. There should be a maximum of 12 students in any first-year writing class.<br><br>
54. First-year writing classes in the Freshman Writing Tutorial should reflect a diversity of academic
training, intellectual disciplines, and subject matters.<br><br>
55. The placement process in the Freshman Writing Tutorial should be reevaluated.<br><br>
56. Those who teach classes in the Freshman Writing Tutorial should be appointed as Lecturers or
ladder faculty, not Preceptors.<br><br>
57. Oral communication should be taught as public speaking and also as debate and oral argument.
A course or courses in rhetoric should be offered.<br><br>
58. The College should hire faculty to teach these courses in rhetoric and public speaking.<br><br>
59. The number of courses in creative writing should be expanded to serve all qualified students.<br><br>
60. Courses in general education and Freshman Seminars that are writing intensive should be
designated in all course listings.<br><br>
61. In each concentration an individual faculty member should be designated responsible for the
overall teaching of writing and speaking.<br><br>
62. The training of Teaching Fellows to teach writing is inadequate. Some departments, the Bok
Center, and the Harvard Writing Project make good, often outstanding efforts, but these are in
general uncoordinated and voluntary. They tend to lapse over time. There are great
inconsistencies. Certain departments and courses exemplify best practices. Those who assign
and therefore also teach writing in departments and degree programs (including Teaching
Fellows) should have an intensive orientation to the teaching of writing. Such training would fall
under the responsibilities of the individual in the department responsible for writing and speaking.<br><br>
63. Specific graduate student funding and fellowships might profitably be tied to writing instruction
in the departments, degree programs, general education, and specific courses in writing and
speaking.<br><br>
64. Departments should explore the joint appointment of teaching personnel hired with the program
in writing and speaking.<br><br>
65. House Masters should encourage House writing tutors, other House tutors, and students to use the
program in writing and speaking as a resource. <br><br>
66. Staff members of the Harvard College Library provide invaluable research and writing assistance
to students and faculty. In each concentration, the faculty liaison to KAP, in conjunction with the
Head Tutor or DUS, should ensure that connections between students and appropriate library staff
are established and maintained.<br><br>
67. Pending the final report of the Committee on General Education, any courses offered in rhetoric
or public speaking might be considered to fulfill part of the requirement in General Education.<br><br>
68. The College should confer a certificate in writing and speaking on graduates who complete, over
and above the one-term course required in the first year, three additional courses selected from
the following: a writing-intensive freshman seminar, a course in creative writing, a course in
rhetoric, a writing-intensive general education course, a course in public speaking. At least one
of these three courses must be in either public speaking or rhetoric. Conferral of such a certificate
should be recorded on the transcript.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T21">REPORT OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON ADVISING AND COUNSELING</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Over the course of the 2004-2005 academic year, the Standing Committee on Advising and
Counseling considered a number of recommendations from the 2004 Curricular Review report related to
improving academic advising in Harvard College. Our findings and recommendations are detailed below.<br><br>
Perhaps most importantly, we realize that improving advising will depend on fostering a deep awareness
among all stakeholders of the centrality of advising to the academic mission of Harvard College. We call
on faculty and students alike to be actively engaged in giving and seeking advice, as a fundamental aspect
of the intellectual exploration and growth that is the goal of our work together as a community, and we
also call on the leadership of our Faculty to make the improvement of advising a high priority.<br><br>
charge<br><br>
Of the dozen or more recommendations on advising in last year’s Harvard College Curricular
Review report, our committee was charged with giving particular (although not exclusive) consideration
to five:<br><br>
Creating an office to coordinate all aspects of academic advising.<br><br>
Separating pre-concentration academic advising from first year residential proctoring.<br><br>
Involving more faculty in pre-concentration and concentration advising.<br><br>
Assigning all concentrators to a concentration adviser.<br><br>
Assigning freshmen to a House before the start of freshman year.<br><br>
main recommendations<br><br>
We endorse enthusiastically the establishment of an Associate Dean of Advising Programs in the
College and have recommendations concerning role and function. We also recommend that an
advisory board be established to assist the new Dean.<br><br>
We recognize the critical role and importance of advising. Advising is an intrinsic and important
part of the academic mission of the College, and needs to be improved. We believe that more
engagement in advising, particularly by faculty, is essential to the success of any curricular
innovations.<br><br>
We recommend that all faculty participate in some way in undergraduate advising.<br><br>
We recommend recruiting more academic advisers (faculty or administrators) for freshmen. As
often as possible, these advisers would serve through the three terms prior to the formal decision about concentration choice. We endorse a more consistent role for House advising in the first
semester of sophomore year.<br><br>
We propose establishment of a formal peer advising program.<br><br>
We have drafted an advising calendar to clarify advising tasks and responsibilities for both
advisers and students, for both pre-concentration and concentration periods.<br><br>
The quality of written and electronic needs improvement.<br><br>
Concentrations should engage more actively in developing advising programs for preconcentrators.<br><br>
Concentrations should ensure that every student has an identifiable concentration adviser.<br><br>
We recommend ongoing evaluation of advisers and monitoring of advising programs, and the use
of collected data to determine best practices in advising.<br><br>
We recommend no change in freshmen assignment to Houses.<br><br>
Success in improving our advising systems will depend to a considerable extent on strong and
sustained leadership from the Dean of the College, Dean of the Faculty, and President, and we
endorse and encourage their involvement.<br><br>
the committee<br><br>
Committee membership is listed in Appendix 1. It included students, tenured faculty, current and
former-House Masters, current and former-Allston Burr Senior Tutors, current and former-Head Tutors
and Directors of Undergraduate Studies (along with Associates and Assistants), the incoming Dean of
Freshmen, Associate and Assistant Deans of Freshmen, Deputy and Assistant Deans of Harvard College,
and representatives of the Bureau of Study Counsel and the Office of Career Services. The committee
was very ably assisted by John O’Keefe and Inge Ameer, who participated fully in our work.<br><br>
Soon after our first meeting on October 1, 2004 we broke up into four subcommittees:<br><br>
Residential advising (Wendy Torrance, Jay Harris, Catherine Shapiro, Diane Weinstein, Tom
Dingman, Inge Ameer)<br><br>
Academic advising (Anya Bernstein, David Borden, Marie Dahleh, Daniel Donoghue, Donald
Pfister, Gregg Tucci, Inge Ameer)<br><br>
Peer advising (Rory Browne, Sandra Nadaff, Stuart Shieber, Danny Yagan, Patricia O’Brien,
John O’Keefe, Inge Ameer)<br><br>
Calendar (Anya Bernstein, David Borden, Rory Browne, Wendy Torrance, Danny Yagan, John
O’Keefe, Inge Ameer)<br><br>
All committees met frequently throughout the year.<br><br>

information reviewed<br><br>
We had available to us several reports documenting and analyzing data from various Freshman
and Senior Surveys regarding satisfaction with the advising systems and advisers, along with other
aspects of student life. We learned that student satisfaction levels were lower than in almost all peer
institutions. Some analyses provided insight into those components of effective advising leading to
higher levels of student engagement and satisfaction. We also had information on advising systems at a
number of peer institutions, which was suggestive of practices that might be adopted at Harvard.<br><br>
We met with undergraduates, including representatives of the Prefect Program and the
Undergraduate Council, as well as other students, with the coordinator of the Freshman Outdoor Program,
with Masters, with Senior Tutors and Assistant Deans of Freshmen, and with Jane Edwards, Director of
the Office of International Programs. (An important task for the immediate future is to meet with
representatives of concentrations.)<br><br>
Professor Richard Light of the Harvard Graduate School of Education joined us at one of our
meetings for a very profitable session. Professor Light, an authority on assessing educational programs,
is the author of “Making the Most of College” which we read, enjoyed, and learned from.<br><br>
our understanding of “advising”<br><br>
Many of the faculty think of “advising” as strictly academic, related rather narrowly to a
particular discipline and focusing especially on concentration course requirements. The committee
adopted a broader view, and tried to see advising through the eyes of a student.<br><br>
Good advising addresses the academic (including international experiences, summer, and career
options), extra-curricular, and personal interests and concerns of the student, and should be built on as
long-term relationships as possible. Good academic advisers, although perhaps most comfortable with
curricular aspects of advising, should also be able to engage with the whole student, and should be
sufficiently knowledgeable about requirements and opportunities to be able to provide the necessary
advice themselves or know where to direct a student.<br><br>
Good advising requires clarity of expectations on all sides; students need to be as prepared to
discuss and explore as they expect their advisers to be, and to see the advising relationship as interactive.
Advising in College differs from that in High School. It is not prescriptive, but rather a collaborative
form of teaching involving gathering and weighing information, planning, and making informed
decisions. Just as faculty should see advising as a form of teaching, students should see advising as a part
of learning.<br><br>
Although it might seem ideal to have a single person as one’s adviser throughout one’s student
career, this is both impractical and to an extent even undesirable. There are inevitable divisions of labor
between the more academic and more personal, between pre-concentration and concentration, and a
reasonable degree of redundancy in an advising system is valuable for everyone and indeed should be
seen as a strength. We encourage each student to assemble, with our assistance, the informal equivalent
of a “board of advisers.”<br><br>
Good advising also requires that we streamline and simplify as far as possible information about
advising, and this would include rather more standardization of adviser titles than we currently present to
students. It also includes continuing to work towards greater simplification, or at least clarity, of our curricular requirements, to make it possible for advisers and students alike to know with confidence that
they are exploring the available options while doing the work necessary to earn a Harvard degree.<br><br>
faculty role in advising<br><br>
As noted earlier, we would like the Faculty to endorse the expectation that all faculty participate
in some way in the undergraduate advising system. We would like this expectation to be encouraged and
reinforced as often as possible by the Dean of the Faculty and Dean of the College.<br><br>
We heard from a variety of sources the suggestion that all faculty should serve as official
academic advisers. We believe this may be unrealistic―perhaps some faculty’s advising talents are not
best suited to one-on-one advising―yet we believe that all faculty are able to be part of our advising
efforts, broadly understood, and urge the faculty to affirm that goal. We all have our strengths; we all
have our weaknesses. Many of us are or would make good one-on-one advisers. We need the help of
others though, as we broaden advising opportunities (in a coordinated and rational way) to meet our
students’ needs. Faculty can serve on informational panels, or participate in workshops for future
concentrators, or have lunch with students in their courses, or be available to advise on particular topics.<br><br>
current advising systems<br><br>
We devote considerable resources to undergraduate advising, and have an overall system that is
highly decentralized. We would not wish or expect this decentralization to change radically, but we
should aspire both to make sure that each component functions as well as possible, and that each is
effectively coordinated with other components. The main components of our advising system today are
as follows.<br><br>
Freshman year<br><br>
The Dean and Associate Dean of Freshmen oversee advising programs for first-year students, as
well as working with concentrations to help students define their future interests. Three Assistant Deans
of Freshmen, one for each of the Yards into which the class is divided, are resident deans serving as links
between various members of a student’s advising team. Proctors are resident freshmen advisers
responsible for the full range of a student’s academic and personal interests. There are 62 Proctors, each
serving as residential adviser to between 20 and 30 freshmen. Although numbers vary from year to year,
this year there are around 232 non-resident freshmen academic advisers, advising on average 2 students
each. This means that most freshmen (around three quarters of the class) receive their academic advice,
as well as their more personal counseling, from their Proctor. Prefects are upperclass students assigned to
particular entryways, who help integrate freshmen into the Harvard community both socially and
academically.<br><br>
The Houses<br><br>
As students move into the House system, they also currently join their concentration. Detailed
advising about courses and concentration requirements becomes the responsibility of the academic
departments, complemented by House advising systems directed at more general academic questions and
personal issues. The Allston Burr Senior Tutors serve as resident academic deans for the students in their
Houses, and oversee academic and personal advising in the residential setting. Houses have between 18
and 27 Resident Tutors, depending on the size of the House. These tutors are usually graduate students in
Arts and Sciences or one of the professional schools, who help with advising in their specific area of academic expertise. Each of these tutors also provides advice and oversight to 20 to 30 students living in
their entryway or on their floor. In collaboration with the Office of Career Services, each House provides
pre-law, pre-medical, and fellowship advising, with tutors (resident and non-resident) dedicated to these
tasks. Each House also provides a system of non-concentration advising, although these programs differ
from House to House. Houses also provide a base for some concentration advising, since some
departments assign specific advising tasks (including study card signing) to resident and non-resident
tutors in the Houses.<br><br>
The Concentrations<br><br>
Advising systems in the concentrations vary, but all are overseen by a Head Tutor or Director of
Undergraduate Studies. This officer is often, but by no means always, a tenured faculty member. Some
of these Head Tutors and Directors of Undergraduate Studies, along with others with Assistant, Associate,
Deputy, or Executive labels, are so-called Dedicated Advisers. These are concentration advisers who
may have teaching appointments but whose principal responsibilities involve advising and who are well
trained and motivated as advisers. Several concentrations rely on the help of graduate students in the field
for advising duties, including the signing of study cards; in some cases, these are organized by House.<br><br>
Some concentrations include their own concentrators as Peer Concentration Advisers, most frequently
used at the freshman concentration fairs and in panel discussions.<br><br>
Supporting the backbone of departmental and residential advising are several other places where
students can seek advice on specific topics or get general help. Some of the more heavily used include:
Bureau of Study Counsel
This counseling center provides a wide range of academic, psychological, and consultative
services to undergraduates. The Bureau consults with advisers (Proctors, resident deans and tutors,
faculty) when there are concerns about a particular student, and is involved (and will continue to be
involved) with various training programs for advisers. It is also the authorized source for Harvard
College on-campus peer tutoring, and is responsible for training Peer Tutors.<br><br>
Office of Career Services<br><br>
The Office assists students with career exploration and planning as part of academic and career
development, including summer jobs, internships, fellowships, sources of funding, international
experiences, and graduate and professional school applications. The Office also works through the
Houses to coordinate pre-med, pre-law, and fellowships advising.<br><br>
Office of International Programs<br><br>
The Office works with students through all stages of planning and preparation for study abroad.<br><br>
problems with current systems<br><br>
In our discussions, five key problems surfaced that should be addressed as part of any serious
effort to provide more effective advising, which in turn can help students be more engaged with and
satisfied by their work at Harvard. Our recommendations seek to address these problems:<br><br>
Students often find our highly decentralized advising systems difficult to navigate.<br><br>

Advisers can be hard to identify. Although concentrations may have procedures to assign
students to advisers, students often do not understand the system and may fail to identify their
adviser.<br><br>
Expectations for both advisers and advisees may be unclear or confusing.<br><br>
Quality of advice is too variable.<br><br>
Electronic and written information can be overwhelming, and too variable in quality and clarity.<br><br>
Advisers are not as well supported as they should be through training and dissemination of best
practices, nor accountable with regard to their performance.<br><br>
recommendations<br><br>
We assumed that the timing of concentration choice will shift to the end of the third semester,
decoupling what are currently coordinated changes: concentration choice and the shift from Yard to
House.<br><br>
Our recommendations reflect our belief that advising systems should be clearer, simpler, and
better coordinated, and advisers better supported. We believe that during what will probably be the first
three pre-concentration semesters every student should have identifiable, knowledgeable, and available
academic advisers, and no adviser should have an excessive number of academic advisees (ideally, no
more than ten and preferably far fewer). After the third semester, every concentrator should also have an
identifiable, knowledgeable, and available adviser. We endorse a role for peers in both pre-concentration
and concentration advising systems.<br><br>
advising dean<br><br>
We endorse the recent appointment of an Associate Dean of Advising Programs in the College
Dean’s Office, and hope it is clear that, although the position may deal primarily with academic advising,
it will do so in the broadest possible context and with the understanding that the academic, extracurricular,
and personal aspects of student life are fundamentally inseparable. The position is “Dean of”
and not “Dean for” Advising Programs because we do not see this as an office to which students will go
for advice (although some certainly will), but as an office which will, over time, help to improve the
effectiveness of all our advising.<br><br>
We recommend that the Associate Dean of Advising have regular access to and meetings with
both the Dean of the College and the Dean of the Faculty, as well as the Academic Deans, for example
being consulted when dossiers are reviewed on commitment to and effectiveness within advising
programs. As we have already noted, success in improving advising will depend to a considerable extent
on the degree of involvement, support, and encouragement for the Dean, and in sending a clear message
that advising is important.<br><br>
The new Office of Advising will need adequate staff support, space, and resources.<br><br>
Some of the recommended functions of the Advising Office can be listed as follows:<br><br>
Improving the consistency and coordination of Freshman, House, and Concentration advising
utilizing the Advising Calendar (see below);<br><br>
Working with the Freshman Deans, Concentration and House advisers, the Office of Career
Services, Bureau of Study Counsel, and Office of International Programs to organize, expand and
improve the effectiveness of workshops and panel discussions for students prior to concentration
choice;<br><br>
Improving the quality, consistency, and comparability of written and electronic information,
particularly from concentrations;<br><br>
Improving adviser training programs in collaboration with the Freshman Deans, Concentration
and House advisers, the Office of Career Services, Bureau of Study Counsel, and Office of
International Programs;<br><br>
Serving as “prompter” for advisers and advisees, for example through developing simple
reminders about important topics for advising conversations that can be sent to advisers and
advisees at appropriate times;<br><br>
Developing tools to evaluate and assess advisers and advising systems, with a view to sharing
best practices;<br><br>
As soon as possible, developing an Annual Report to the Faculty on the quality of our advising
programs; and<br><br>
The committee recommends that it be reconstituted as an advisory board to the Dean of Advising.
advising calendar<br><br>
Attached as Appendices 2 and 3 are Advising Calendars, one for advisers and the other for
advisees. Our goal in preparing these is to spell out what we believe to be the minimal acceptable level of
advising, including its frequency, content, and medium. (For example, we propose as a reasonable
minimal expectation at least three meetings per year for students once in a concentration.) We believe
that regular reminders to advisers and advisees can help, and we are also agreed that students need to take
more responsibility in preparing for and seeking advice, just as individual advisers and the advising
systems have responsibility to provide timely, accurate, and thoughtful advice.<br><br>
These calendars will undoubtedly undergo modification. To have their desired effect, they will
depend upon the active cooperation of all components of our advising system. Appendix 4 (“Harvard
Advising Page”) is presented as an example of how an over-arching advising web-page might look, using
the advising calendar as its backbone, taking a student (and adviser) to ever increasing levels of
specificity. As a specific (“Who”) example, we show the Senior Tutor link.<br><br>
changes to the first three semesters<br><br>
We have assumed that concentration choice will fall at the end of the third semester, and that the
roles of academic and residential adviser should be separated, when feasible. We have also paid attention
to the third semester (first semester of sophomore year), which now becomes a time in which, although
living in a House, students are not yet formally in a concentration.<br><br>


We emphasize that, even were concentration choice timing not to change, we would still make
the recommendations that follow. Of particular importance to us are pre-concentration advising as
delivered by the concentrations themselves, the role of House advising in sophomore year, and attention
on the part of all advisers to non-concentration coursework.<br><br>
The current structure of freshman advising can be briefly summarized as follows.<br><br>
There are 3 Assistant Deans of Freshmen, the Yard resident dean equivalents of the House
Allston Burr Senior Tutors. Each has responsibility for almost 550 students (in contrast, Allston Burr
Senior Tutors are responsible for between 330 and 450 students, depending on the House).<br><br>
Every first year student has a resident adviser, called a Proctor. Proctors have a variety of
educational backgrounds and future plans, and some are graduates of Harvard College. There are 62
Proctors, and each is responsible for on average 26 students (the actual number of proctees varying from
around 20 to more than 35).<br><br>
There are currently around 232 Non-Resident Academic Advisers (the number varies from year
to year), advising on average 2 students each. Most Non-Resident Academic Advisers are non-ladder
faculty, administrators, and others in the Harvard College community. This year, 65 Non-Resident
Academic Advisers are ladder faculty.<br><br>
This means that barely 460 of our freshmen have Non-Resident Academic Advisers, the
remaining 1200 or so having their Proctors as academic as well as residential advisers. Number of
academic advisees (as opposed to proctees) per Proctor ranged this year between 11 and 24, with the
average a little below 20.<br><br>
We have identified some weaknesses in the first year advising experience, and the paragraphs that
follow try to address them. These weaknesses would include mismatch of interest between adviser and
advisee, insufficiently effective training for advisers, too little time for all the advising needs, and the
need for more involvement and input from the concentrations.<br><br>
We recommend first, that the number of Assistant Deans of Freshmen be increased from 3 to 4,
bringing the ratio of advisees to Assistant Dean close to the ratio of advisees to Senior Tutor in the
Houses.<br><br>
Currently Proctors act as both academic and residential advisers to a group of between 20 and 30
students. For most freshmen, their Proctor is also their academic adviser, but in those instances where a
freshman has a non-resident academic adviser, their Proctor has fewer academic advisees. Proctors
currently average almost 20 academic advisees. We would not recommend separating totally the groups
of academic and residential advisers because this would reduce the attractiveness of the Proctor position,
making it totally unlike a House Resident Tutorship. Rather we would like to reduce the number of
academic advisees per Proctor (to no more than ten, preferably many fewer) by increasing the number of
non-resident academic advisers. The quality of the Proctor pool needs to be maximized and we should of
course make every effort to ensure that all Proctors are fully knowledgeable about the Harvard College
curriculum. In turn, we need to consider ways of improving the attractiveness of the Proctor position to
make it more equivalent to a House resident tutorship, both by making the academic advising load lighter
and, for example, by improving housing conditions.<br><br>
We recommend that every effort be made to increase the overall number of academic advisers,
thereby reducing the maximum number of academic advisees per Proctor to a reasonable number. For
example, we believe that the number of suitable and recruitable faculty is certainly higher than 65. The serious involvement of our Faculty leaders will be critical to successful expansion of this number. We
also believe that there are other underutilized pools of possible effective advisers throughout the Harvard
community. Training and support for all these advisers needs to be thoroughly reviewed in order to make
both training and operation as efficient as is compatible with good advising.<br><br>
Non-Resident Academic Advisers are normally assigned to provide as close a match as possible
to the expressed academic interests of incoming freshmen. We believe that it is worth considering the
feasibility of adopting the same criterion for Proctors. We propose that, once it is possible to reduce the
number of academic advisees per Proctor to an acceptable number, Proctors be assigned as academic
advisers as far as possible matching the academic interests of students, whether inside or outside of their
own Proctor group.<br><br>
If we can reach an acceptable number of academic advisers, we propose that they continue as
often as possible as official advisers into the third semester, and would therefore work with the Allston
Burr Senior Tutors as they did with Assistant Deans of Freshmen during freshman year (it may be that the
Senior Tutor would designate a representative, perhaps an Assistant Senior Tutor with enhanced role to
monitor advice for these third semester students). In some cases, the freshman academic adviser may not
be available for a student’s third semester, in which case the existence of good House-based advising will
become critical. We anticipate that many students will already have made decisions concerning
concentration choice by the time they join a House, but some will still need guidance in choosing courses
to help in narrowing choices. There is a clear role for the Dean of Advising to work with the various
academic advisers, particularly the Houses and concentrations, as well as with the Office of Career
Services, the Bureau of Study Counsel, and the Office of International Programs to improve the
consistency and coordination of advising both prior to and after concentration choice. And we emphasize
again the importance for all advisers to pay attention to non-concentration as well as concentration course
planning (especially as the structure of both concentration and general education requirements change).<br><br>
Over the course of these first three semesters the issue of concentration choice grows increasingly
important, and the active cooperation and involvement of concentrations is critical. We have heard some
complaints about the quality of pre-concentration advising during freshman year. To a considerable
extent the solution to any problems that do exist will require more thoughtful participation by the
concentrations themselves. We discuss this more fully in the section below on concentrations.<br><br>
peer advising<br><br>
We discussed peer advising with a number of students, including representatives of the Prefects
and the Undergraduate Council. We recognize the great importance of contact between freshmen and
upperclass students, and have a number of proposals to strengthen them.<br><br>
We understand that peer advising systems cannot supplant, replace, or cover the deficiencies of
current or future systems of academic or residential advising. But new students often find other students
more approachable than faculty and administrators, and seek them out anyway; they have confidence in
their opinions and perspectives. Further, many upper-class students are eager to participate and have a
unique perspective on the undergraduate experience that cannot be readily supplied by other forms of
advising. Advising about academic requirements and course choice is properly the responsibility of the
concentrations, the faculty, and other accredited residential and non-residential advisers. However,
students are uniquely placed to talk to their newly arrived peers about the challenges and opportunities
presented by life and learning in a residential undergraduate college within the wider context of a research
university, and to help them navigate, both literally and metaphorically, within the academic calendar and
around the many and therefore often confusing advising resources.<br><br>

We recommend establishing a comprehensive peer advising system covering all first-years, with
a formal program name and adviser title to be approved at a later time (see Appendix 5). We recommend
that every incoming student be assigned a specific peer adviser and be contacted and welcomed by that
adviser before arrival on campus.<br><br>
The proposed peer advisers would replace and augment the integrating and introductory functions
performed by participants in such existing programs as the Prefect Program. The new system would be
centrally supervised and managed through the Dean of Advising office to ensure consistency and
coverage. Upperclass students would, however, play an integral part in the recruitment, selection, and
training of each generation of peer advisers, and would work closely with, and be consulted by the dean
of advising office.<br><br>
We further recommend that Concentrations be strongly encouraged to recruit and use upperclass
students to serve as Peer Concentration Counselors (as many currently do). It would be sensible to
integrate them into one new unified program (Appendix 5). To provide material assistance to the
concentrations in the task of organizing, recruiting, and advertising a peer concentration counselor
program, we propose that the advising dean’s office, which would oversee the peer advising program,
also be involved in planning and coordinating with the concentrations. (Collaboration with the Freshman
Dean’s office and the Bureau of Study Counsel would also continue.)<br><br>
We also recommend the extension, organizational reform, greater support, and diversification of
the several existing pre-orientation programs, such as the Freshman Outdoor Program (FOP), the
Freshman Arts Program (FAP), and Freshman Urban Program (FUP). The structure of the programs
should maintain and further emphasize their role in achieving the social integration and adaptation to
college life that at their best they perform so well. More incoming students should have the opportunity
and the inclination to participate in any one of a number of different experiences that provide them with a
peer support structure, even before they arrive on campus (and which will continue into their first term
here).<br><br>
concentrations<br><br>
Concentrations and their representatives have critically important roles to play in advising
students. Students often comment on both the disappointing as well as the satisfying engagements they
have with individual advisers in their concentrations, which highlights the importance of supporting and
enhancing the connection of adviser and advisee on a personal level. Other steps will help improve the
overall impression of advising efforts in departments across the College.<br><br>
We reviewed reports and analyses of student satisfaction levels with concentration advising,
noting some general trends. Satisfaction tends to be modestly inversely correlated with number of
concentrators, and with concentrator/faculty ratios. (We need to be mindful of the fact that low
satisfaction levels are also occasionally found in a few smaller concentrations.) We noted that, when
these variables were held constant, the presence of a Dedicated Adviser often had a positive influence on
satisfaction. Such advisers work well not because they substitute for faculty but because they provide
predictable presence and continuity and facilitate a range of contacts between concentrators and faculty
members.<br><br>
The larger concentrations in particular face a number of challenges with advising. In addition to
large numbers of concentrators and high concentrator/faculty ratios, with the best will in the world they
face challenges in organizing teaching in such a way as to ensure that a student can take small classes
from and get to know the faculty. We recognize that student-faculty classroom contact, which can lead to conversations unrelated to course content (that is, advising), plays a major role along with advising in
overall satisfaction. However, we recommend that as a reasonable expectation there should be at least
three meetings per year for students with an identifiable adviser, once they have declared a concentration.
Almost 50 percent of concentrators are in only 6 of our more than 40 concentrations. Perhaps
more attention could focus during freshman year, not on dissuading students from concentrating in the
larger concentrations, but on the many opportunities available in the smaller concentrations. But we
know from student surveys that concentration choice overwhelmingly reflects intellectual (as opposed to
career) interests, so we need to redouble our efforts to increase student satisfaction with advising in larger
concentrations.<br><br>
We recommend therefore that the Dean of the College convene a series of meetings with the
larger concentrations in which the Dean of Advising would be involved, to discuss ways of improving
advising. One option would be to increase the involvement of Dedicated Advisers. However, problems
of scale need also to be recognized here. A concentration with 70 students may function well with one
ladder faculty and/or a Dedicated Adviser as Director of Undergraduate Studies/Head Tutor. Expecting a
concentration an order of magnitude larger to function equally well with one ladder faculty or a Dedicated
Adviser is quite unrealistic. It might, for example, be useful to consider ways of subdividing larger
concentrations into potentially more manageable subgroups for advising purposes. Larger concentrations
need proportionately more resources, and perhaps considerably more resources than they currently
receive.<br><br>
We found that concentration websites varied considerably in format, content, and quality. We
recommend that the dean of advising work with concentrations to raise overall quality and clarity, making
websites sufficiently similar in organization as to make comparative analysis easy for students. We also
found great variability in the way the structure of advising is described across concentrations, and can
imagine how confusing this might be to freshmen trying to navigate their way through our complex
systems. Again, the Dean of Advising can be of help in improving this situation.<br><br>
The Science concentrations already make presentations during freshman week. Comparable
presentations from Social Science and Humanities concentrations worked well this year, exposing
students to disciplines they may be unfamiliar with. For each Division we also encourage panel
discussions throughout the first three semesters, in which thoughtful comparisons of the various
concentrations can be presented and discussed. (For example, what are the differences between Social
Studies and Government, or between Biochemistry and Chemistry?) Versions should be available in
electronic formats.<br><br>
Along these lines, a booklet briefly articulating the philosophy and goals of each concentration,
and logical grouping of concentrations, would be useful. Such a booklet might include very brief essays
on each concentration, organized by Division, along with brief overview essays for each Division,
recommendations on how to think about planning a course of study, and perhaps some suggestions on
course choice. A similar booklet on General Education could be produced once decisions are made about
structure.<br><br>
Outreach from concentrations to freshmen and first semester sophomores needs to be proactive
and regular, and we recommend that each concentration designate an adviser or group of advisers
specifically to contact and interact with potential concentrators. We also encourage all concentrations to
consider the appropriate use of peer concentration advisers. We learned from conversations with students
that such advising is important to them when done well, but that degree of involvement of students and
the quality of their training varies greatly. As noted above, we recommend that peer concentration advisers become part of an integrated peer advising system (Appendix 5). The dean of advising has a
useful role to play in exploring with concentrations the best use of students as peer advisers.<br><br>
We repeat here our original expectation that all faculty should be involved in some way in the
advising process. Whether this is acting as a concentration adviser, serving in a “pool” of faculty
advisers, appearing on panels and in discussion groups and workshops, participating in social events, or
joining students in a course for lunch, we all have an obligation to recognize that, great research
institution though this is, we are all also faculty of Harvard College. At the same time it is equally
essential that students recognize their responsibilities to be active participants: to attend each advising
session fully prepared; and to follow Professor Light’s advice, as described in his book, to get to know at
least one faculty member every semester.<br><br>
Finally, we acknowledge need for concentration advisers to be at least aware of the nonconcentration
course planning of their advisees. A reduction in the number of concentration requirements
will increase the responsibilities of both students and advisers in this area. The dean of advising can play
an important role, along with concentrations and the Freshman Dean’s Office, in organizing all of these
activities.<br><br>
houses<br><br>
We spent relatively little time reviewing advising in the Houses, and noted that students are
generally very satisfied with their House experiences. The House Masters, Allston Burr Senior Tutors,
Resident Tutors and Non-Resident affiliates advise on a range of topics, academic and non-academic. It
would be timely to examine the extent to which variability in House advising practices needs some
adjustment. We believe that there needs to be a reasonable amount of consistency in at least the third
semester phase of pre-concentration advising, and recommend a role for the advising dean in convening
workshops to explore ideas maximizing efficiency and consistency.<br><br>
pre-assignment of freshmen to a house<br><br>
Our final charge was to examine the possible value of assigning freshmen to a House prior to
arrival on campus. The 2004 Curricular Review report had recommended such pre-assignment, along
with housing students assigned to particular Houses together in their Yard dormitories, as part of an
improved advising system. This would also facilitate interaction with upperclass peers. Accordingly, we
considered the extent to which pre-assignment would strengthen both academic advising and peer contact.
Over the course of our discussions, we also became mindful of the stress felt by some students during the
“blocking” process. As students form groups (up to 8 in number) prior to entering the housing lottery,
decisions about and reactions to inclusion within and exclusion from blocking groups can be potentially
devastating for students. So we approached our analysis with a view to understanding if pre-assignment
would have a positive impact on three issues: academic advising, peer contact, and blocking stress.<br><br>
In order to do justice to these important questions we need to weigh pros and cons, and to do this
we needed to have some idea of what a pre-assignment system might look like. We tried some simple
modeling. There are many different possible pre-assignment models, and we developed just two. These
are explained more fully in Appendix 6, but can briefly be characterized as the “Yale” and “Princeton”
models. We concluded that neither would improve advising as well as would our recommended changes.<br><br>
The geography of the Harvard campus, very different from Yale’s, would make the operation of a Yaletype
system extremely difficult, and could, in our view, have a potentially negative effect on advising.<br><br>
Peer contact we believe can be most efficiently effected through the development of an integrated peer preassignment
could be considered again. If it is, it should be considered early in any planning for new
Houses, because geography will be critical to the success of any change.<br><br>
We also discussed blocking stress and, although not directly related to our task of reviewing
academic advising, concluded that this is a topic worthy of further careful consideration. (We began
developing some tentative suggestions for modifying the current system. For example, emphasizing to
students that forming blocking groups of 3 or 4―closer to the size of actual future rooming groups,
should be seen as quite acceptable and “normal.”) We recommend that the Dean of the College convene
a small group to develop suggestions for improving current procedures.<br><br>
final comments<br><br>
Advising is vitally important to any academic enterprise, and especially to Harvard College as it
enters a period of curricular innovation and change. Harvard is fortunate to have outstanding faculty, but
without better advising the advantages they offer students will be dissipated. Good advising can only
enhance what students gain from their college years.<br><br>
To bring adequate focus to its importance, we urge the leadership of the Faculty and University to
make clear in all possible ways the seriousness with which the institution is going to take advising. We
can evaluate advising systems, and advisers, as we do courses. We can be asked to discuss our role in
advising in our Annual Reports to the Dean. Performance of advising systems can be a prominent part of
annual departmental staffing meetings. Involvement in advising can be considered along with teaching
ability in appointments and promotions. Complementary to these initiatives, we must provide better
training, support, assistance, and guidance for advisers.<br><br>
The state of student-faculty relations at Harvard College has sometimes been caricatured as a
“culture of mutual avoidance.” Changing this aspect of academic culture cannot be treated as an
insurmountable challenge. We must be aggressive in finding ways of making students fully active
partners in our advising systems, helping them to recognize that advising is an integral part of learning.
But we must take the lead.<br><br>
