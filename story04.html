National Security Council (NSC)	<br><br>
The White House National Security Council (NSC) is the principal forum used by the President of the United States for considering national security and foreign policy matters with his senior national security advisors and Cabinet officials and is part of the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Since its inception under Harry S. Truman, the function of the Council has been to advise and assist the president on national security and foreign policies. The Council also serves as the president's principal arm for coordinating these policies among various government agencies. The Council has counterparts in the national security councils of many other nations.	<br><br>
The National Security Council was created in 1947 by the National Security Act. It was created because policymakers felt that the diplomacy of the State Department was no longer adequate to contain the USSR in light of the tension between the Soviet Union and the United States.[1] The intent was to ensure coordination and concurrence among the Navy, Marine Corps, Army, Air Force and other instruments of national security policy such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), also created in the National Security Act.	<br><br>
On May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama merged the White House staff supporting the Homeland Security Council (HSC) and the National Security Council into one National Security Staff (NSS). The HSC and NSC each continue to exist by statute as bodies supporting the President.[2]	<br><br>
The decision process inside the structure has become less and less formal but influence of the Council has become stronger and stronger. Detailed history of the National Security Council under each Presidential administration since its inception can be found at:	<br><br>

	<b><a name="T2">Cybersecurity</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

“America’s economic prosperity, national security, and our individual liberties depend on our commitment to securing cyberspace and maintaining an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet. Our critical infrastructure continues to be at risk from threats in cyberspace, and our economy is harmed by the theft of our intellectual property. Although the threats are serious and they constantly evolve, I believe that if we address them effectively, we can ensure that the Internet remains an engine for economic growth and a platform for the free exchange of ideas.”	<br><br>
President Obama	<br><br>
Five Things to Know: The Administration's Priorities on Cybersecurity	<br><br>
1. Protecting the country's critical infrastructure ― our most important information systems ― from cyber threats. 	<br><br>
2. Improving our ability to identify and report cyber incidents so that we can respond in a timely manner.	<br><br>
3. Engaging with international partners to promote internet freedom and build support for an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace.	<br><br>
4. Securing federal networks by setting clear security targets and holding agencies accountable for meeting those targets.	<br><br>
5. Shaping a cyber-savvy workforce and moving beyond passwords in partnership with the private sector. 	<br><br>
Cyberspace touches nearly every part of our daily lives. It's the broadband networks beneath us and the wireless signals around us, the local networks in our schools and hospitals and businesses, and the massive grids that power our nation. It's the classified military and intelligence networks that keep us safe, and the World Wide Web that has made us more interconnected than at any time in human history. We must secure our cyberspace to ensure that we can continue to grow the nation’s economy and protect our way of life.	<br><br>
The Administration is employing the following principles in its approach to strengthen cybersecurity:	<br><br>
* Whole-of-government approach	<br><br>
* Network defense first	<br><br>
* Protection of privacy and civil liberties	<br><br>
* Public-private collaboration	<br><br>
* International cooperation and engagement	<br><br>
On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed Executive Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.” Read more about Executive Order 13636.	<br><br>
Protect Critical Infrastructure	<br><br>
The government must work collaboratively with critical infrastructure owners and operators to protect our nation’s most sensitive infrastructure from cybersecurity threats.   Specifically, we are working with industry to increase the sharing of actionable threat information and warnings between the private sector and the U.S. Government and to spread industry-led cybersecurity standards and best practices to the most vulnerable critical infrastructure companies and assets.	<br><br>
* The Administration issued E.O. 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in 2013	<br><br>
* The Administration launched a follow-on Cybersecurity Framework, a guide developed collaboratively with the private sector for private industry to enhance their cybersecurity, in 2014	<br><br>
Improve Incident Reporting and Response	<br><br>
We must enhance our ability to detect and characterize cyber incidents, share information about them, and respond in a timely manner.  These efforts encompass network defense, law enforcement, and intelligence collection initiatives, so we can better understand our potential adversaries in cyberspace.	<br><br>
* Awareness of a cyber threat or incident C and quickly acting on that information -- are critical prerequisites to effective incident response. As directed in E.O. 13636, the U.S. Government has developed systems and procedures to increase the timeliness and quality of cyber threat information shared with at-risk private sector entities. We are placing great emphasis on unity of effort by agencies with a domestic response mission	<br><br>
Engage Internationally	<br><br>
Because cyberspace crosses every international boundary, we must engage with our international partners.  We will work to create incentives for, and build consensus around, an international environment where states recognize the value of an open, interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace.   We will oppose efforts to restrict internet freedoms, eliminate the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, or impose political and bureaucratic layers unable to keep up with the speed of technological change.  An open, transparent, secure, and stable cyberspace is critical to the success of the global economy.	<br><br>
* We are continuing to pursue the policy objectives laid out in the U.S. International Strategy for Cyberspace including: ~ Developing international norms of behavior in cyberspace	<br><br>
~ Promoting collaboration in cybercrime investigations (Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty modernization)	<br><br>
~ International cybersecurity capacity building	<br><br>
Secure Federal Networks	<br><br>
We must improve the security of all federal networks by setting clear targets for agencies and then hold them accountable to achieve those targets. We are also deploying improved technology to enable more rapid discovery of and response to threats to federal data, systems, and networks.	<br><br>
* The Cybersecurity Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal represents the Administration's highest cybersecurity priorities for securing unclassified federal networks. 	<br><br>
Shape the Future Cyber Environment	<br><br>
We are also looking to the future. We are working to develop a cyber-savvy workforce and ultimately to make cyberspace inherently more secure. We will prioritize research, development, and technology transition and harness private sector innovation while ensuring our activities continue to respect the privacy, civil liberties and rights of everyone. 	<br><br>
* The federal government is partnering with the private sector and academia to encourage and support the innovation needed to make cyberspace inherently more secure. 	<br><br>

	<hr><br>
<a href= "pic09.html">CIA Report</a><br><br>
	
17-Jan-14	<br><br>
Presidential Policy Directive -- Signals Intelligence Activities	<br><br>
PRESIDENTIAL POLICY DIRECTIVE/PPD-28	<br><br>
SUBJECT: Signals Intelligence Activities	<br><br>
The United States, like other nations, has gathered intelligence throughout its history to ensure that national security and foreign policy decisionmakers have access to timely, accurate, and insightful information.	<br><br>
The collection of signals intelligence is necessary for the United States to advance its national security and foreign policy interests and to protect its citizens and the citizens of its allies and partners from harm. At the same time, signals intelligence activities and the possibility that such activities may be improperly disclosed to the public pose multiple risks. These include risks to: our relationships with other nations, including the cooperation we receive from other nations on law enforcement, counterterrorism, and other issues; our commercial, economic, and financial interests, including a potential loss of international trust in U.S. firms and the decreased willingness of other nations to participate in international data sharing, privacy, and regulatory regimes; the credibility of our commitment to an open, interoperable, and secure global Internet; and the protection of intelligence sources and methods.	<br><br>
In addition, our signals intelligence activities must take into account that all persons should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their nationality or wherever they might reside, and that all persons have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information.	<br><br>
In determining why, whether, when, and how the United States conducts signals intelligence activities, we must weigh all of these considerations in a context in which information and communications technologies are constantly changing. The evolution of technology has created a world where communications important to our national security and the communications all of us make as part of our daily lives are transmitted through the same channels. This presents new and diverse opportunities for, and challenges with respect to, the collection of intelligence C and especially signals intelligence. The United States Intelligence Community (IC) has achieved remarkable success in developing enhanced capabilities to perform its signals intelligence mission in this rapidly changing world, and these enhanced capabilities are a major reason we have been able to adapt to a dynamic and challenging security environment.1	<br><br>
The 1 For the purposes of this directive, the terms "Intelligence Community" and "elements of the Intelligence Community" shall have the same meaning as they do in Executive Order 12333 of December 4, 1981, as amended (Executive Order 12333).	<br><br>
United States must preserve and continue to develop a robust and technologically advanced signals intelligence capability to protect our security and that of our partners and allies. Our signals intelligence capabilities must also be agile enough to enable us to focus on fleeting opportunities or emerging crises and to address not only the issues of today, but also the issues of tomorrow, which we may not be able to foresee.	<br><br>
Advanced technologies can increase risks, as well as opportunities, however, and we must consider these risks when deploying our signals intelligence capabilities. The IC conducts signals intelligence activities with care and precision to ensure that its collection, retention, use, and dissemination of signals intelligence account for these risks. In light of the evolving technological and geopolitical environment, we must continue to ensure that our signals intelligence policies and practices appropriately take into account our alliances and other partnerships; the leadership role that the United States plays in upholding democratic principles and universal human rights; the increased globalization of trade, investment, and information flows; our commitment to an open, interoperable and secure global Internet; and the legitimate privacy and civil liberties concerns of U.S. citizens and citizens of other nations.	<br><br>
Presidents have long directed the acquisition of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence2 pursuant to their constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. They have also provided direction on the conduct of intelligence activities in furtherance of these authorities and responsibilities, as well as in execution of laws enacted by the Congress. Consistent with this historical practice, this directive articulates principles to guide why, whether, when, and how the United States conducts signals intelligence activities for authorized foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.3	<br><br>
Section 1. Principles Governing the Collection of Signals Intelligence.	<br><br>
Signals intelligence collection shall be authorized and conducted consistent with the following principles:	<br><br>
(a) The collection of signals intelligence shall be authorized by statute or Executive Order, proclamation, or other Presidential directive, and undertaken in	<br><br>
2 For the purposes of this directive, the terms "foreign intelligence" and "counterintelligence" shall have the same meaning as they have in Executive Order 12333. Thus, "foreign intelligence" means "information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations, foreign persons, or international terrorists," and "counterintelligence" means "information gathered and activities conducted to identify, deceive, exploit, disrupt, or protect against espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign powers, organizations, or persons, or their agents, or international terrorist organizations or activities." Executive Order 12333 further notes that "[i]ntelligence includes foreign intelligence and counterintelligence."	<br><br>
3 Unless otherwise specified, this directive shall apply to signals intelligence activities conducted in order to collect communications or information about communications, except that it shall not apply to signals intelligence activities undertaken to test or develop signals intelligence capabilities. accordance with the Constitution and applicable statutes, Executive Orders, proclamations, and Presidential directives.	<br><br>
(b) Privacy and civil liberties shall be integral considerations in the planning of U.S. signals intelligence activities. The United States shall not collect signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent, or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Signals intelligence shall be collected exclusively where there is a foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purpose to support national and departmental missions and not for any other purposes.	<br><br>
(c) The collection of foreign private commercial information or trade secrets is authorized only to protect the national security of the United States or its partners and allies. It is not an authorized foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purpose to collect such information to afford a competitive advantage4 to U.S. companies and U.S. business sectors commercially.	<br><br>
(d) Signals intelligence activities shall be as tailored as feasible. In determining whether to collect signals intelligence, the United States shall consider the availability of other information, including from diplomatic and public sources. Such appropriate and feasible alternatives to signals intelligence should be prioritized.	<br><br>
Sec. 2. Limitations on the Use of Signals Intelligence Collected in Bulk.	<br><br>
Locating new or emerging threats and other vital national security information is difficult, as such information is often hidden within the large and complex system of modern global communications. The United States must consequently collect signals intelligence in bulk5 in certain circumstances in order to identify these threats. Routine communications and communications of national security interest increasingly transit the same networks, however, and the collection of signals intelligence in bulk may consequently result in the collection of information about persons whose activities are not of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence value. The United States will therefore impose new limits on its use of signals intelligence collected in bulk. These limits are intended to protect the privacy and civil liberties of all persons, whatever their nationality and regardless of where they might reside.	<br><br>
In particular, when the United States collects nonpublicly available signals intelligence in bulk, it shall use that data	<br><br>
4 Certain economic purposes, such as identifying trade or sanctions violations or government influence or direction, shall not constitute competitive advantage.	<br><br>
5 The limitations contained in this section do not apply to signals intelligence data that is temporarily acquired to facilitate targeted collection. References to signals intelligence collected in "bulk" mean the authorized collection of large quantities of signals intelligence data which, due to technical or operational considerations, is acquired without the use of discriminants (e.g., specific identifiers, selection terms, etc.). only for the purposes of detecting and countering: (1) espionage and other threats and activities directed by foreign powers or their intelligence services against the United States and its interests; (2) threats to the United States and its interests from terrorism; (3) threats to the United States and its interests from the development, possession, proliferation, or use of weapons of mass destruction; (4) cybersecurity threats; (5) threats to U.S. or allied Armed Forces or other U.S or allied personnel; and (6) transnational criminal threats, including illicit finance and sanctions evasion related to the other purposes named in this section. In no event may signals intelligence collected in bulk be used for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent; disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion; affording a competitive advantage to U.S. companies and U.S. business sectors commercially; or achieving any purpose other than those identified in this section.	<br><br>
The Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor (APNSA), in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), shall coordinate, on at least an annual basis, a review of the permissible uses of signals intelligence collected in bulk through the National Security Council Principals and Deputies Committee system identified in PPD-1 or any successor document. At the end of this review, I will be presented with recommended additions to or removals from the list of the permissible uses of signals intelligence collected in bulk.	<br><br>
The DNI shall maintain a list of the permissible uses of signals intelligence collected in bulk. This list shall be updated as necessary and made publicly available to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with the national security.	<br><br>
Sec. 3. Refining the Process for Collecting Signals Intelligence.	<br><br>
U.S. intelligence collection activities present the potential for national security damage if improperly disclosed. Signals intelligence collection raises special concerns, given the opportunities and risks created by the constantly evolving technological and geopolitical environment; the unique nature of such collection and the inherent concerns raised when signals intelligence can only be collected in bulk; and the risk of damage to our national security interests and our law enforcement, intelligence-sharing, and diplomatic relationships should our capabilities or activities be compromised. It is, therefore, essential that national security policymakers consider carefully the value of signals intelligence activities in light of the risks entailed in conducting these activities.	<br><br>
To enable this judgment, the heads of departments and agencies that participate in the policy processes for establishing signals intelligence priorities and requirements shall, on an annual basis, review any priorities or requirements identified by their departments or agencies and advise the DNI whether each should be maintained, with a copy of the advice provided to the APNSA.	<br><br>
Additionally, the classified Annex to this directive, which supplements the existing policy process for reviewing signals intelligence activities, affirms that determinations about whether and how to conduct signals intelligence activities must carefully evaluate the benefits to our national interests and the risks posed by those activities.6	<br><br>
Sec. 4. Safeguarding Personal Information Collected Through Signals Intelligence.	<br><br>
All persons should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their nationality or wherever they might reside, and all persons have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information.7 U.S. signals intelligence activities must, therefore, include appropriate safeguards for the personal information of all individuals, regardless of the nationality of the individual to whom the information pertains or where that individual resides.8	<br><br>
(a) Policies and Procedures. The DNI, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall ensure that all elements of the IC establish policies and procedures that apply the following principles for safeguarding personal information collected from signals intelligence activities. To the maximum extent feasible consistent with the national security, these policies and procedures are to be applied equally to the personal information of all persons, regardless of nationality:9	<br><br>
i. Minimization. The sharing of intelligence that contains personal information is necessary to protect our national security and advance our foreign policy interests, as it enables the United States to coordinate activities across our government. At the same time, however, by setting appropriate limits on such sharing, the United States takes legitimate privacy concerns into account and decreases the risks that personal information will be misused or mishandled. Relatedly, the significance to our national security of intelligence is not always apparent upon an initial review of information: intelligence must be retained for a sufficient period of time for the IC to understand its relevance and use	<br><br>
6 Section 3 of this directive, and the directive's classified Annex, do not apply to (1) signals intelligence activities undertaken by or for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in support of predicated investigations other than those conducted solely for purposes of acquiring foreign intelligence; or (2) signals intelligence activities undertaken in support of military operations in an area of active hostilities, covert action, or human intelligence operations.	<br><br>
7 Departments and agencies shall apply the term "personal information" in a manner that is consistent for U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons. Accordingly, for the purposes of this directive, the term "personal information" shall cover the same types of information covered by "information concerning U.S. persons" under section 2.3 of Executive Order 12333.	<br><br>
8 The collection, retention, and dissemination of information concerning "United States persons" is governed by multiple legal and policy requirements, such as those required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Executive Order 12333. For the purposes of this directive, the term "United States person" shall have the same meaning as it does in Executive Order 12333.	<br><br>
9 The policies and procedures of affected elements of the IC shall also be consistent with any additional IC policies, standards, procedures, and guidance the DNI, in coordination with the Attorney General, the heads of IC elements, and the heads of any other departments containing such elements, may issue to implement these principles. This directive is not intended to alter the rules applicable to U.S. persons in Executive Order 12333, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or other applicable law.	<br><br>
it to meet our national security needs. However, long-term storage of personal information unnecessary to protect our national security is inefficient, unnecessary, and raises legitimate privacy concerns. Accordingly, IC elements shall establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to minimize the dissemination and retention of personal information collected from signals intelligence activities.	<br><br>
*Dissemination: Personal information shall be disseminated only if the dissemination of comparable information concerning U.S. persons would be permitted under section 2.3 of Executive Order 12333.	<br><br>
*Retention: Personal information shall be retained only if the retention of comparable information concerning U.S. persons would be permitted under section 2.3 of Executive Order 12333 and shall be subject to the same retention periods as applied to comparable information concerning U.S. persons. Information for which no such determination has been made shall not be retained for more than 5 years, unless the DNI expressly determines that continued retention is in the national security interests of the United States.	<br><br>
Additionally, within 180 days of the date of this directive, the DNI, in coordination with the Attorney General, the heads of other elements of the IC, and the heads of departments and agencies containing other elements of the IC, shall prepare a report evaluating possible additional dissemination and retention safeguards for personal information collected through signals intelligence, consistent with technical capabilities and operational needs.	<br><br>
ii. Data Security and Access. When our national security and foreign policy needs require us to retain certain intelligence, it is vital that the United States take appropriate steps to ensure that any personal information contained within that intelligence is secure. Accordingly, personal information shall be processed and stored under conditions that provide adequate protection and prevent access by unauthorized persons, consistent with the applicable safeguards for sensitive information contained in relevant Executive Orders, proclamations, Presidential directives, IC directives, and associated policies. Access to such personal information shall be limited to authorized personnel with a need to know the information to perform their mission, consistent with the personnel security requirements of relevant Executive Orders, IC directives, and associated policies. Such personnel will be provided appropriate and adequate training in the principles set forth in this directive. These persons may access and use the information consistent with applicable laws and Executive Orders and the principles of this directive; personal information for which no determination has been made that it can be permissibly disseminated or retained under section 4(a)(i) of this directive shall be accessed only in order to make such determinations (or to conduct authorized administrative, security, and oversight functions).	<br><br>
iii. Data Quality. IC elements strive to provide national security policymakers with timely, accurate, and insightful intelligence, and inaccurate records and reporting can not only undermine our national security interests, but also can result in the collection or analysis of information relating to persons whose activities are not of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence value. Accordingly, personal information shall be included in intelligence products only as consistent with applicable IC standards for accuracy and objectivity, as set forth in relevant IC directives. Moreover, while IC elements should apply the IC Analytic Standards as a whole, particular care should be taken to apply standards relating to the quality and reliability of the information, consideration of alternative sources of information and interpretations of data, and objectivity in performing analysis.	<br><br>
iv. Oversight. The IC has long recognized that effective oversight is necessary to ensure that we are protecting our national security in a manner consistent with our interests and values. Accordingly, the policies and procedures of IC elements, and departments and agencies containing IC elements, shall include appropriate measures to facilitate oversight over the implementation of safeguards protecting personal information, to include periodic auditing against the standards required by this section.	<br><br>
The policies and procedures shall also recognize and facilitate the performance of oversight by the Inspectors General of IC elements, and departments and agencies containing IC elements, and other relevant oversight entities, as appropriate and consistent with their responsibilities. When a significant compliance issue occurs involving personal information of any person, regardless of nationality, collected as a result of signals intelligence activities, the issue shall, in addition to any existing reporting requirements, be reported promptly to the DNI, who shall determine what, if any, corrective actions are necessary. If the issue involves a non-United States person, the DNI, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the head of the notifying department or agency, shall determine whether steps should be taken to notify the relevant foreign government, consistent with the protection of sources and methods and of U.S. personnel.	<br><br>
(b) Update and Publication. Within 1 year of the date of this directive, IC elements shall update or issue new policies and procedures as necessary to implement section 4 of this directive, in coordination with the DNI. To enhance public understanding of, and promote public trust in, the safeguards in place to protect personal information, these updated or newly issued policies and procedures shall be publicly released to the maximum extent possible, consistent with classification requirements.	<br><br>
(c) Privacy and Civil Liberties Policy Official. To help ensure that the legitimate privacy interests all people share related to the handling of their personal information are appropriately considered in light of the principles in this section, the APNSA, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) shall identify one or more senior officials who will be responsible for working with the DNI, the Attorney General, the heads of other elements of the IC, and the heads of departments and agencies containing other elements of the IC, as appropriate, as they develop the policies and procedures called for in this section.	<br><br>
(d) Coordinator for International Diplomacy. The Secretary of State shall identify a senior official within the Department of State to coordinate with the responsible departments and agencies the United States Government's diplomatic and foreign policy efforts related to international information technology issues and to serve as a point of contact for foreign governments who wish to raise concerns regarding signals intelligence activities conducted by the United States.	<br><br>
Sec. 5. Reports.	<br><br>
(a) Within 180 days of the date of this directive, the DNI shall provide a status report that updates me on the progress of the IC's implementation of section 4 of this directive.	<br><br>
(b) The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is encouraged to provide me with a report that assesses the implementation of any matters contained within this directive that fall within its mandate.	<br><br>
(c) Within 120 days of the date of this directive, the President's Intelligence Advisory Board shall provide me with a report identifying options for assessing the distinction between metadata and other types of information, and for replacing the "need-to-share" or "need-to-know" models for classified information sharing with a Work-Related Access model.	<br><br>
(d) Within 1 year of the date of this directive, the DNI, in coordination with the heads of relevant elements of the IC and OSTP, shall provide me with a report assessing the feasibility of creating software that would allow the IC more easily to conduct targeted information acquisition rather than bulk collection.	<br><br>
Sec. 6. General Provisions.	<br><br>
(a) Nothing in this directive shall be construed to prevent me from exercising my constitutional authority, including as Commander in Chief, Chief Executive, and in the conduct of foreign affairs, as well as my statutory authority. Consistent with this principle, a recipient of this directive may at any time recommend to me, through the APNSA, a change to the policies and procedures contained in this directive.	<br><br>
(b) Nothing in this directive shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority or responsibility granted by law to a United States Government department or agency, or the head thereof, or the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. This directive is intended to supplement existing processes or procedures for reviewing foreign intelligence or counterintelligence activities and should not be read to supersede such processes and procedures unless explicitly stated.	<br><br>
(c) This directive shall be implemented consistent with applicable U.S. law and subject to the availability of appropriations.	<br><br>
(d) This directive is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.	<br><br>

"We Were Strangers Once, Too": The President Announces New Steps on Immigration<br><br>
Tanya Somanader<br><br>
November 20, 2014 <br><br>
09:25 PM EST<br><br>

"Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger -- we were strangers once, too. My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too."<br><br>

-- President Obama, November 20, 2014<br><br>

Since the founding of our nation, we've weaved a tradition of welcoming immigrants into the very fabric of who we are. It's what keeps us dynamic, entrepreneurial, and uniquely American. <br><br>

But, as we know all too well, America's immigration system is broken. So tonight, President Obama addressed the nation on the executive actions he is taking to help fix what he can:<br><br>

1. We will build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel. 
<br><br>
Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it’s been in nearly two years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s.  Those are the facts.<br><br>

2. We will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. <br><br>

3. We will take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.
<br><br>
Read more about the details of the President's actions at WhiteHouse.gov/Immigration-Action.
<br><br>
Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart.
<br><br>
We are a nation of immigrants, and we are a nation of laws. We must hold accountable those who broke the law, while understanding that the mass deportation of millions of Americans is neither possible nor in keeping with who we are as Americans. That is why the President is focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security: "Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who's working hard to provide for her kids." <br><br>
"I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common-sense law."<br><br>

 
So here is the deal the President put forward tonight: <br><br>

If you’ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes -- you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law.
<br><br>
Here is what this deal is not: Amnesty. Amnesty is the immigration system we have now, in which millions of people live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, and politicians use this issue to scare and divide Americans. 
<br><br>
That's the real amnesty -- leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What I’m describing is accountability -- a common-sense, middle ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you’re a criminal, you’ll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.
<br><br>
The best and most definitive way to fix the system is to pass comprehensive and common-sense immigration reform in Congress. Last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and independents in the Senate came together to do just that. That bipartisan bill would have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents; given undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they pay a fine, start paying taxes, and go to the back of the line; and boosted our economy while shrinking the deficit.<br><br>


 
"What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal -- that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will."<br><br>

 
But more than 500 days later, Republicans in the House continue to block the bipartisan bill from a vote. "Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of a bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law," the President noted. 
<br><br>
So the President had to act, just as every president since President Eisenhower has over this last half century. 
<br><br>
To those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill.
<br><br>
At the heart of the President's actions is a commitment to who we are as a nation. We are a nation that values families and works together to keep them together. We are a nation that educates the world's best and brightest, and encourages them to stay and create jobs here. 
<br><br>
We are a nation that welcomes the tired, the poor, and the huddled weary who yearn to breathe free and build a better life for their children.
<br><br>
As the President said: 
<br><br>
Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger -- we were strangers once, too.
<br><br>
My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship.  What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal C that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will.

	<b><a name="T5">Fixing Our Broken Immigration System</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
<a href= "link04.html">Affordable Care Act</a><br><br>
	
November 21, 2014 <br><br>
FACT SHEET: The Economic Benefits of Fixing Our Broken Immigration System<br><br>
The President’s Immigration Accountability Executive actions will help secure the border, hold nearly 5 million undocumented immigrants accountable and ensure that everyone plays by the same rules.  Acting within his legal authority, the President is taking an important step to fix our broken immigration system.<br><br>

These executive actions crack down on illegal immigration at the border, prioritize deporting felons not families, and require certain undocumented immigrants to pass a criminal background check and pay their fair share of taxes as they register to temporarily stay in the US without fear of deportation.<br><br>

These are commonsense steps, but only Congress can finish the job. As the President acts, he’ll continue to work with Congress on a comprehensive, bipartisan bill―like the one passed by the Senate more than a year ago―that can replace these actions and fix the whole system.<br><br>

According to an analysis by the President’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the President’s executive actions on immigration would boost economic output by an estimated 0.4 to 0.9 percent over ten years, corresponding to increases in GDP of $90 billion to $210 billion in 2024.  
<br><br>
*The President’s actions will grow the economy by increasing the productivity of all American workers. These actions will increase the productivity of American workers, in part by allowing undocumented workers to come out of the shadows and find jobs that better match their skills and potential. This shift of workers across occupations will also allow more native workers to specialize in the tasks best suited to their abilities. These effects are likely to lead to wage increases for all workers―immigrants and natives alike. In addition, by encouraging high-skilled immigration, these actions will boost the rate of innovation and patenting in the American economy, further increasing the productivity of the American workforce.<br><br>
*The President’s actions will increase the size of the American workforce. CEA estimates that the economy will also grow thanks to an expansion of the American labor force by nearly150,000 people over 10 years as a result of the President’s executive actions.<br><br>
*Average wages for all workers, both U.S.-born and immigrant, will increase. Increases in productivity and innovation caused by the President’s actions will translate into higher wages for all types of workers. CEA estimates that by 2024 annual wages for native workers will rise 0.3 percent, or approximately $170 in today’s dollars. CEA also estimates that the President’s actions would neither increase nor decrease the likelihood of employment for native workers.<br><br>
*A bigger economy will reduce the deficit. As the economy grows so do tax revenues, requiring the government to borrow less to finance government operations. This reduced borrowing translates into reduced spending on interest payments by the government, thus reducing overall government spending―and shrinking the deficit. CEA’s estimate of the higher economic growth associated with executive action on immigration would translate into reductions in the Federal deficit by $25 billion in 2024.<br><br>
At the same time, the President’s executive actions will expand the country’s tax base by millions of people and billions of dollars.  Individuals potentially eligible for deferred action under the President’s executive actions are in the country today C and have been for many years.  They provide for their families, just like all American citizens.  Many are already in the workforce and contributing Federal, State, and local taxes.  But roughly two-thirds of them don’t pay taxes today.  The President is changing that, ensuring that these individuals have the opportunity to apply for a work authorization and pay taxes.  By allowing those eligible for deferred action to work in this country, both workers and employers will be able to come out from the shadows and contribute payroll taxes, just like all American citizens.
<br><br>
To be sure, the economic benefits of these actions are not as strong as those under the bipartisan legislation that passed in the Senate.  If Congress passes that bill, we will be able to fully realize the economic benefits of commonsense immigration reform.  Independent studies have affirmed that commonsense immigration reform would significantly increase economic growth, shrink the deficit, and boost wages for native-born U.S. workers.<br><br>

*Commonsense immigration reform would strengthen the overall economy and grow U.S. GDP.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that enacting the Senate immigration reform bill would increase real GDP relative to current law projections by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033 C an increase of roughly $700 billion and $1.4 trillion, respectively, in today’s dollars.  According to independent estimates, improvements to the agricultural visa program alone would almost immediately increase GDP by $2 billion.<br><br>
*Commonsense immigration reform would increase wages and productivity for American workers.  According to CBO and other independent studies, immigration reform would increase overall U.S. productivity, resulting in higher wages.  CBO estimates that real wages would be 0.5 percent higher in 2033 ― the equivalent to an additional $250 of income for the median American household ― as a result of enacting the Senate bill.  The Senate bill would raise the “wage floor” for all workers―particularly in industries where employers pay undocumented workers low wages under the table and thus drive down the wages of all workers. <br><br>
*Commonsense immigration reform would reduce the federal deficit and strengthen Social Security.  According to CBO, the additional taxes paid by new and legalizing immigrants under the Senate bill would reduce the federal budget deficit by nearly $850 billion over the next 20 years.  The independent Social Security Administration (SSA) Actuary estimates that the Senate bill would add nearly $300 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund over the next decade and would improve Social Security’s finances over the long run, extending Social Security solvency by two years.

November 20, 2014 <br><br>
FACT SHEET: Global Entrepreneurship Summit<br><br>
President Obama elevated entrepreneurship to the forefront of the United States’ engagement agenda during a historic speech in Cairo in 2009.  The Administration has delivered on this commitment, greatly expanding support for entrepreneurship and economic opportunity around the world.  Signature achievements in the past five years include:
<br><br>
*The United States has played a prominent role in organizing five Global Entrepreneurship Summits (GES) that have elevated entrepreneurship on the global agenda and inspired new generations of innovators to choose entrepreneurship as a profession.  These Summits have opened up new markets for products and encouraged policymakers to break down barriers to business, such as the draft law currently being developed by the Moroccan Government to create a legal status for startups.<br><br>
*The Administration has invested in over 1000 initiatives and programs promoting entrepreneurship around the world, many of which are focused on generating opportunities for women and youth and increasing access to capital for entrepreneurs.
*The Unites States sends some of America’s top entrepreneurs abroad through the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship.  Begun earlier this year, the Ambassadors have already met with entrepreneurs and promoted entrepreneurship on four continents. <br><br>
*The United States’ Global Innovation through Science and Technology (GIST) Initiative has helped young scientists from throughout the Muslim world generate more than $80 million in revenue for their companies. <br><br>
*The Administration has committed roughly $3.2 billion to support micro, small, and medium sized enterprises and mobilized $80 million in private capital for startup accelerators in the developing world through development financing institutions and programs.<br><br>
This year’s GES in Marrakech, Morocco brings together nearly 4,000 entrepreneurs and business, government, and thought leaders.  The United States’ delegation is led by Vice President Joe Biden and includes several cabinet members, heads of agencies, and senior U.S. Government officials.  With a focus on technology, this year’s Summit gives participants the opportunity to discover some of the latest trends and tools driving the next wave of innovators.  For the first time, the Summit has a day dedicated to the specific challenges and opportunities relevant to women entrepreneurs, as well as a day-long program for young entrepreneurs.<br><br>

Committing to a Bold New Goal to Spark Global Entrepreneurship<br><br>

Building on the past five years of enhanced support for entrepreneurship, today, the Vice President announced that the United States has committed to a bold new goal to expand economic opportunity for all, especially women and youth.  Bringing together the U.S. Government’s most exceptional entrepreneurship programs, the United States will spark $1 billion in new private investments over the next three years for entrepreneurs worldwide, including social entrepreneurs.  Half of these investments will be generated by women and young entrepreneurs.  In addition, the United States is issuing a call to action to other organizations, companies, and countries to build on this goal.  The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation already pledged its support to this effort, announcing today that the new Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) would generate additional investments for entrepreneurs.  One of the first GEN operations will be in Morocco.
<br><br>


Expanding Entrepreneurship in the Middle East and North Africa<br><br>

To support Morocco’s demand-driven professional training strategy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is expected to invest an estimated $50 million in public-private partnerships that provide students with the skills employers need.  Starting in January, MCC and the Moroccan Government will solicit ideas from the private sector, government, and civil society to develop public-private training partnerships.  Pending MCC Board approval and Congressional Notification, the program will be included as part of a new compact agreement that is expected to be signed in 2015.
<br><br>
Through the Middle East and North Africa Investment Initiative, the U.S. government is launching new partnerships with the Shell Foundation in Iraq to provide financial and practical support to small and medium sized businesses run by entrepreneurs.  In Lebanon, through a new partnership with Berytech, the U.S. government will provide early capital and advice for entrepreneurs, as well as mentoring, business networks, and other support as they grow and create even more jobs and economic activity. 
<br><br>



As announced by the Vice President today, the United States and Volvo are partnering to establish a training academy for entrepreneurs in Morocco.  The academy will train 150 students each year from Morocco, Cote d’Ivoire, and Senegal, focusing on maintenance of industrial and commercial equipment.  Training will also include technology and general business skills to prepare graduates to enter the modern workforce C either employed by local or multinational companies like Volvo, or as entrepreneurs running their own businesses.
<br><br>
In partnership with Spain, the U.S. government is providing a USD7 million credit guarantee to help finance a state-of-the-art cold storage facility at the Tanger-Med port in Morocco.  The cold storage facility will fill a crucial gap in the agriculture value chain in Morocco, enabling increased agricultural exports to key markets and facilitating job creation across the sector.  This effort supports the U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement and Morocco’s agricultural modernization strategy.<br><br>







Enhancing Networking and Resources for Entrepreneurs
<br><br>
To deepen engagement and networking among entrepreneurs, GIST has partnered with nine investment, entrepreneurial, education, and corporate organizations to create GIST Net (www.gistnetwork.org).  This global, user-driven online platform will connect science and technology entrepreneurs in emerging economies and provide them with the ongoing resources and mentorship they need to collaborate, seek funding, and grow their businesses.  GIST Net will keep science and technology innovators informed on the latest news, trends, and industry insights and enable them to connect with each other and experts around the globe.  This public-private partnership gives science and technology entrepreneurs access to wide-ranging resources, such as interactive learning tools, mentors, potential financing, and advice, thanks to the intellectual and creative contributions of the U.S. Department of State, Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, Founder Institute, Gust, NestGSV, NovoED, Ponscio, Stanford Technology Ventures Program, TechWadi, and VentureWell.  Additionally, GIST and Global Entrepreneurship Week will expand the 1 Million Cups entrepreneurial education program globally.  1 Million Cups facilitates a weekly, in-person forum at which entrepreneurs present their startups to a diverse audience of mentors, advisors, and their peers and receive feedback in a safe environment, helping them to advance their businesses. 
<br><br>
Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship and Coursera Co-Founder and CEO, Daphne Koller, has developed a new online series of courses for entrepreneurs.  The Coursera Specialization in Entrepreneurship will focus on training entrepreneurs how to develop a business model, discover customer insights, enhance sales and marketing techniques, and pitch their venture.  The entrepreneurship curriculum allows for students to generate an innovative new venture concept or enhance their existing concepts.  At the end of the course, students will create an investor pitch.  Through a competitive process, leading concepts will be evaluated for funding by experts and investors.  The Specialization in Entrepreneurship was created in partnership with University of Maryland, College Park.
<br><br>
Salman Khan, a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship, has launched a new set of free online tutorials through Khan Academy for creating and designing a website C a critical first step for most entrepreneurs in the 21st century.<br><br>

Launching the J. Christopher Stevens Virtual Exchange Initiative
<br><br>
Increased connectivity is inspiring global citizenship, driving young people to seek connections with peers outside of their communities, and encouraging them to tackle local and global challenges.  The United States is committed to cultivating a new generation of globally-minded youth, and announced today a major contribution to this effort.  The J. Christopher Stevens Virtual Exchange Initiative, a multilateral public-private partnership, will strengthen engagement between young people in the Middle East and North Africa and in the United States as a lasting tribute to the legacy of Ambassador Chris Stevens. <br><br>

The J. Christopher Stevens Virtual Exchange Initiative will use technology and online tools to achieve the largest-ever increase in people-to-people educational exchanges between the United States and the broader Middle East.  Through intensive, structured online engagements between youth at various education levels, the Initiative will equip more than one million youth with the skills and aptitudes they need to succeed in the 21st century and lessen the potential for global misunderstanding.<br><br>

A number of governments have expressed their intent to contribute to and partner with the United States on this Initiative.  To date, the Kingdom of Morocco and the governments of Algeria, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have joined the United States in making financial pledges totaling over $31 million over the next five years.  In addition, the Initiative will involve foundations and private sector partners, including Microsoft and GoPro.  The J. Christopher Stevens Virtual Exchange Initiative will be kicked off with a pilot project early next year in Morocco.

November 19, 2014 <br><br>
FACT SHEET: ConnectED to the Future<br><br>
Today, President Obama hosts school leaders and educators from across the country at the White House for “ConnectED to the Future,” a day-long convening to explore the potential of education technology and the innovations needed to bring America’s schools into the digital age.  At the event, the President will launch his Administration’s effort to assist school leaders in their transition to digital learning, following his plan to connect 99 percent of America’s students high-speed broadband internet in their schools and libraries. The President will applaud superintendents across the country that will collaborate with students, educators, and parents to become “Future Ready.”  
<br><br>
More than 1,200 school superintendents will join the Obama Administration’sFuture Ready District Pledge to set a vision for digital learning across America.  These educational leaders will foster a culture of learning through technology across their schools; assist their students and families in the transition to high-speed connectivity; provide their learners greater access to high-quality digital devices and content; and provide teachers and principals the support needed to use technology in innovative ways.  Together, they will reach approximately 10 million students across more than 16,000 schools across all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
<br><br>
Preparing America’s students with the skills they need to get good jobs and compete in the global economy demands an interactive, personalized learning experience.  According to the FCC, 68% of school districts report that not a single school in their district can meet high-speed connectivity goals. Too few American schools have the broadband connections necessary to support innovative teaching and learning and most lack the wireless connectivity to individualize instruction for students. <br><br>

In June 2013, President Obama visited Mooresville, NC to announce the ConnectED initiative, beginning with a call to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enable the connectivity and high-speed broadband needed to spur 21st century learning for America’s students within five years.  Since that time, the FCC has taken steps to modernize the E-rate program to support high-speed connectivity for America’s schools and libraries, providing a $2 billion down payment toward the President’s ConnectED goals.  Additionally, private-sector companies have committed more than $2 billion to supplement federal actions and help support cutting-edge technologies across a greater number of schools and homes.
<br><br>

Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and President Barack Obama of the United States met in Brisbane, Australia on 16 November 2014 in the margins of the G20 Leaders’ Summit.<br><br>

The leaders expressed their commitment to deepening the trilateral partnership among Australia, Japan and the United States to ensure a peaceful, stable, and prosperous future for the Asia-Pacific region. They noted that this partnership rests on the unshakable foundation of shared interests and values, including a commitment to democracy and open economies, the rule of law, and the peaceful resolution of disputes.<br><br>

The three leaders reaffirmed the global reach of their cooperation and the value of comprehensive US engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. They resolved to tackle pressing issues such as: degrading and ultimately defeating the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and countering the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters; ending the deadly Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa; and opposing Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea and its actions to destabilize eastern Ukraine, and bringing to justice those responsible for the downing of Flight MH17. The three leaders also underscored the strength of their regional cooperation, including eliminating the North Korean nuclear and missile threat; addressing human rights in North Korea including the abductions issue; and ensuring freedom of navigation and over-flight and the peaceful resolution of maritime disputes in accordance with international law, including through legal mechanisms such as arbitration.<br><br>

The leaders expressed their firm commitment to deepen the already strong security and defense cooperation among the three countries and to strengthen the collective ability to address global concerns and promote regional stability through enhanced cooperation on: trilateral exercises; maritime security capacity building and maritime domain awareness; peacekeeping capacity building, particularly in the area of prevention of violence against women; increasing development assistance coordination throughout the region; humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; cyber capacity building; and defense equipment and technology. They welcomed work being done to this end and directed their governments to expand trilateral cooperation in all of these areas.<br><br>

The leaders resolved to continue to work together and with our partners in the region to promote strong sustainable growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific, including through cooperation in the G20, APEC, EAS and other regional forums to promote sustainable, inclusive, and resilient growth and prosperity, free trade and investment, including in infrastructure development and energy efficiency.

<a href= "pic10.html">Russia Uprise</a><br><br>
	
November 14, 2014 <br><br>
FACT SHEET: The President's Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative<br><br>
Today in Rangoon, Burma, President Obama announced a significant expansion of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative (YSEALI) at a town hall with 400 youth from the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
<br><br>
YSEALI is the President’s signature initiative to strengthen leadership development across ASEAN, deepen engagement with young leaders on key regional and global challenges, and strengthen people-to-people ties between the United States and Southeast Asia.  Deepening collaboration with young leaders is a critical element of the United States’ rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region and of cultivating an ASEAN community.  Recognizing that over 65 percent of ASEAN’s population is under the age of 35, YSEALI is a critical investment in the next generation of Southeast Asian leaders.
<br><br>
YSEALI Fellowship<br><br>

The YSEALI Fellowship will bring 500 exceptional young leaders from ASEAN countries to the United States on an annual basis, to further develop their professional and leadership skills in priority areas including entrepreneurship and economic empowerment, environment and natural resources management, and civic engagement.  These emerging leaders, aged 18-35, will build on their ideas and experiences while further cultivating their skills to lead their region and the world.<br><br>

The 500 YSEALI Fellows will be divided between the YSEALI Academic Fellows and the YSEALI Professional Fellows.  YSEALI Academic Fellows will engage 250 current or recently graduated students from ASEAN member countries in five week institutes at pre-eminent U.S. universities and colleges.  The institutes will include an academic residency, leadership development, an educational study tour, local community service activities, and opportunities to engage with American peers.  The program will conclude in Washington, D.C. to allow for networking with policy makers, government representatives, businesses, and think tanks.  YSEALI Professional Fellows will enable 250 young leaders from ASEAN to work directly with American counterparts in non-profit organizations and state and local government offices across the United States for five weeks to enhance their practical expertise, leadership skills, and professional contacts to address challenges and create new opportunities in their home communities and countries.  Fellows will also travel to Washington, D.C. to engage with counterparts from other regions, as well as policy makers, government representatives, and other leaders.   Upon returning home, Fellows will connect with their peers across the region through the larger YSEALI and U.S. exchange alumni network.  This network will help young leaders build on their U.S. experience and address regional and local issues through grant competitions, regional workshops, and other opportunities.  In 2015, a YSEALI summit will take place in the Asia-Pacific region.<br><br>


YSEALI Regional Networks<br><br>

The YSEALI Fellowship is part of a broader suite of programs and engagements that support the goals and aspirations of young ASEAN leaders.  YSEALI Generation Regional Exchanges cultivate a regional network for ASEAN youth to collaborate on solving common challenges and creating new opportunities.  In 2014, over 300 emerging leaders benefited from professional development workshops focusing on mentoring, hands-on training, and the tools necessary to successfully make a positive impact in their communities.  The next YSEALI Generation Regional Exchange will be held in Singapore December 3-7, 2014, and will concentrate on workforce readiness.  Working in partnership with the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, participants will examine ways governments, businesses, civil society organizations, and young people can help new job seekers build skills in high demand by international employers. YSEALI Generation Regional Exchanges are also being planned in Cambodia and Vietnam, and will focus on developing young leaders’ professional skills and understanding of the environment, entrepreneurship, and civic engagement.  Approximately 100 YSEALI members from across ASEAN will participate.
<br><br>
Since the President launched YSEALI nearly a year ago, more than 10,000 young people from ASEAN have become members of the YSEALI Network.  YSEALI virtually connects leaders from across the region and offers an array of resources, networking opportunities, and trainings.  The web-based platform encourages young people across the region to collaborate on tackling issues of shared concern, providing them with an avenue to further their own development through courses on leadership, entrepreneurship, and professional skills.  The YSEALI website regularly updates network members about upcoming events, courses, resources, and opportunities.
<br><br>
Youth Action and Leadership Development
<br><br>
The United States is expanding YSEALI Seeds for the Future grants to support young Southeast Asian leaders’ most promising and innovative ideas for civic engagement, education, entrepreneurship and economic development, and environment and natural resources management.  This groundbreaking grant competition helps match entrepreneurial emerging leaders with their peers in other Southeast Asian countries, and encourages them to work together to solve regional challenges in partnership with the United States.  To date, one third of the over 60 international teams that competed to receive funding are in the process of implementing their solutions.  The next competition will open in early 2015, featuring a per-team maximum award of $20,000.  More information is available online at www.youngsoutheastasianleaders.state.gov.
<br><br>
Science, Technology, and Entrepreneurship
<br><br>
Through the ASEAN-U.S. Science and Technology Fellows Program, the United States is developing a cadre of young science leaders that can effectively influence the policymaking process at national and regional levels.  In its first year, seven scientists participated in the program.  ASEAN has approved a cadre of 16 to participate over the next four years.  Fellows are embedded within a government office in their home country for one year and work on a variety of tasks to increase their understanding of the governance and policy process.  The program also trains the fellows to develop strong leadership skills and awareness of ASEAN goals and objectives.
<br><br>
The ASEAN Economic Community promotes skilled labor mobility to increase job opportunities and people-to-people connectivity across the region.  In the Lower Mekong countries -- Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam -- skilled workers are in high demand by the private sector but in short supply.  The United States is addressing this problem through the new Connecting the Mekong through Education and Training (COMET) program.  This five-year (2014-2019) program will help universities and vocational education centers increase the number of skilled youth in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, accounting, and tourism through targeted curriculum and training that directly meets the demands of local employers in high-growth industries.  COMET will leverage the interest and commitment of private sector partners, such as Google, which will provide technical services, training, and IT solutions over the life of the program.
<br><br>
Civic Engagement
<br><br>
The United States encourages youth to give back to their local communities, strengthening civil societies in their home countries.  In August 2013, the United States and Malaysia launched the ASEAN Youth Volunteer Program, which encourages young volunteers (18-30 years old) from all ASEAN countries to serve in the region, while enhancing cross-cultural ties and understanding among ASEAN youth.  Over five weeks, volunteers learn about community development and form lifelong friendships with peers from across ASEAN.  Nearly 150 youth have participated to date in programs in Malaysia; the next programs will take place in Cambodia, the Philippines, and Burma.  The ASEAN Youth Volunteers Program is funded through a $1.4 million grant from the United States, in partnership with the Government of Malaysia, the ASEAN Secretariat, and the University Kabangsaan Malaysia.
<br><br>
Thailand’s Khon Kaen University, with support from the United States, has established Southeast Asia’s first Center for Civil Society and Non-Profit Management to support and cultivate young civil society leaders.  This innovative non-profit school will serve up to 140 university students and 40 practicing civil society leaders each year from throughout the Lower Mekong sub-region, offering coursework to build their non-profit management skills.  Over the next three years, the University will develop Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programs as well as executive certification (non-degree) programs, thus creating professional career paths for young leaders in Southeast Asia who want to give back to society through work in the non-profit sector.  The school also will serve as a regional hub for coordination, best practice exchange, and networking among civil society leaders.

	<hr><br>
	
November 13, 2014 <br><br>
FACT SHEET: 2nd ASEAN-U.S. Summit <br><br>
Today, President Obama met with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders and foreign ministers and the ASEAN Secretariat's Secretary-General at the 2nd ASEAN-U.S. Summit in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar. President Obama reaffirmed the importance of U.S.-ASEAN ties as a crucial element of the United States' strategic rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region and highlighted many of the cooperative activities the United States has undertaken with ASEAN across its economic, political-security, and socio-cultural pillars.<br><br>

Economic Engagement<br><br>

U.S.-ASEAN Expanded Economic Engagement (E3): To expand trade and investment ties between the United States and ASEAN and to create new jobs and business opportunities, President Obama in 2012 announced the creation of an Enhanced Economic Engagement Initiative (E3).  Under the E3, the United States is working with ASEAN to promote trade facilitation, standards development and practices, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and establishing open and transparent investment and information technology environments. In August 2014, U.S. businesses participated in the 2nd ASEAN-U.S. Business Summit, which focused on improving the capacity of SMEs to connect to regional and global supply chains.
<br><br>
Commercial Engagement: The U.S. Departments Commerce and State will sponsor four business and trade delegations to ASEAN next year focused on a range of sectors, including health and energy.  The first delegation will take place in February 2015, going to the Philippines and Indonesia, and focusing on the health sector.  These delegations will visit several ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia, and will be led by senior officials.
<br><br>
Lower Mekong Initiative Business Delegation: The U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and USAID, in cooperation with U.S. businesses, will lead a business delegation to the Lower Mekong region in 2015 to highlight regional energy security and sustainability.  The delegation will complement the Extraordinary Meeting of the Friends of the Lower Mekong scheduled for January 2015, in which eight of the largest donor states and organizations will meet to discuss regional development strategies.<br><br>

ASEAN Reverse Trade Mission and Symposium: In collaboration with the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State, and Energy, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency plans to lead a high-level ASEAN Ministers Energy and Transport Infrastructure Symposium and Reverse Trade Mission in 2015. The event will enhance U.S. economic engagement in Southeast Asia, increase U.S. economic opportunities and jobs, and advance ASEAN's infrastructure priorities targeted by the U.S.-Asia Pacific Comprehensive Energy Partnership (USACEP) and the U.S.-ASEAN Connectivity Cooperation Initiative by connecting policy makers with U.S. suppliers.<br><br>

Advancing Entrepreneurship and Business Growth: The U.S.-ASEAN Business Alliance for Competitive SMEs, a public private partnership between USAID and the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, held training programs in five ASEAN countries and will soon begin creating an online academy to support SMEs in three key areas: access to finance; access to regional and international markets; and access to information and information technology.
<br><br>
ASEAN Integration and ASEAN Single Window (ASW): The United States is supporting the creation of an ASEAN Single Window through the ASEAN Connectivity through Trade and Investment (ACTI) program. The ASW is a hallmark of ASEAN's progress toward building the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015 that is designed to speed customs clearance procedures and lower costs for businesses, allowing increased trade.
<br><br>
Environmentally Sustainable Energy Development: The U.S. Department of Energy, the Department of State and USAID continue to support the U.S.-Asia Comprehensive Energy Partnership, and in 2014 held a workshop on rural electrification with the ASEAN Center for Energy, cosponsored with Brunei a Renewable and Alternative Energy Financing Workshop to highlight financing and technical assistance resources available for renewable energy project, and co-sponsored with Vietnam a regional Unconventional Gas Technical Engagement Program workshop.
<br><br>
Collaborative ASEAN and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Activities: The United States is working to include non-APEC ASEAN members (Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos) in APEC capacity building activities in areas of mutual interest to both organizations so all ASEAN economies fully benefit from this work as ASEAN advances toward the AEC.
<br><br>
Political-Security Engagement<br><br>

Enhancing Maritime Cooperation: As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen U.S.ASEAN defense cooperation in areas including maritime security and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, Secretary of Defense Hagel hosted the ten ASEAN Defense Ministers at an informal meeting In Hawaii in April 2014.  In September 2014, the United States and the Philippines hosted the 2nd Expanded ASEAN Seafarer Training Counter Piracy workshop to exchange best practices on counter-piracy training, welfare, and safety issues in support of ASEAN seafarers.
<br><br>
Combating Piracy:  Also in September, the United States became the 20th contracting party to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), an international organization that serves as a platform for information exchange and for promoting and enhancing cooperation to combat piracy and armed robbery against ships in Asia.
<br><br>
Building ASEAN's Cyber Confidence: The United States is helping to build ASEAN’s capacity to increase cybersecurity cooperation and reduce the risk of conflict during a cyber incident by supporting an ASEAN cybercrime workshop hosted by Singapore in 2014, jointly chairing with Singapore the ASEAN Regional Forum Seminar on Operationalizing Cyber Confidence Building Measures scheduled for 2015.
<br><br>
Combating Human and Wildlife Trafficking: The United States is working with ASEAN partners to combat human and wildlife trafficking.  In October 2014, the United States co-chaired with Burma a seminar on combating trafficking in persons, and is providing training for Heads of Anti-trafficking Specialist Units (HSUs) in crime scene management and victim-centric approaches in investigations. On wildlife trafficking, the United States worked with Myanmar to draft the East Asia Summit Declaration on wildlife Trafficking.
<br><br>
ASEAN Youth Volunteer Program: The United States and the National University of Malaysia entered into a multiyear agreement for USAID to provide support for the ASEAN Youth Volunteer Program (AVYP) to support ASEAN’s efforts to sponsor young volunteers to work throughout ASEAN on solutions to development challenges facing their communities.
<br><br>
Climate Change Cooperation: The United States and ASEAN announced the U.S.-ASEAN Joint Statement on Climate Change, demonstrating their commitment to a successful United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December 2015.
<br><br>
Promoting Women and Children's Rights: In April 2014, the United States and ASEAN launched the ASEAN Women Entrepreneurship Network in Vietnam. The project brings together the resources of USAID, the U.S. Department of State, the ASEAN Committee on Women, and the private sector to provide mentorship, training, and networking resources to women entrepreneurs.
<br><br>
U.S.-ASEAN Science and Technology (S&T) Fellow Program: The United States and the ASEAN Committee on Science and Technology (COST) launched the S&T Fellow Program in April 2014. Seven fellows worked on issues related to biodiversity, climate change, water management, health, and disaster risk reduction. The United States and ASEAN plan to expand the program in 2015.

White House Report: Women and Girls of Color: Addressing Challenges and Expanding Opportunity<br><br>
Today, the White House Council on Women and Girls released a report entitled “Women and Girls of Color: Addressing Challenges and Expanding Opportunity”. This report highlights work the Administration has done over the last six years to reduce barriers to success for everyone including women and girls of color. From continuing to fight to increase the minimum wage, encouraging women to enter STEM-related fields, providing increased access to health screenings and much more, this report re-emphasizes the Administration’s commitment to helping all women succeed in every area of their lives. Read a copy of that report here.<br><br>

At 2:00pm EST today, the Council on Women and Girls will host a meeting with stakeholders at the White House to discuss a range of issues that impact girls and women of color -- including those topics featured within the report -- and to hear from a number of stakeholders on the work they have done and are continuing to do on this critical issue. The event will be livestreamed at www.wh.gov/live.
<br><br>
About the Report:<br><br>

In recent years, on indicators ranging from educational attainment to economic security to health and well-being, women and girls of color have made tremendous progress. The number of businesses owned by women of color has skyrocketed, and women of color have ascended to the upper ranks of workplaces across industries. Teen pregnancy rates for girls of color have plummeted, and high school and college graduation rates have risen.
<br><br>
Yet, these achievements may obscure the very real challenges and disparities that persist for women and girls of color. Girls of color still lag behind in their performance on standardized tests, and they are more likely to be suspended from school. Women and girls of color still face higher rates of poverty and receive lower wages for their work than their white peers, and they are more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system. Women of color still have some of the highest rates of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and other serious conditions, and they experience high rates of domestic violence. And when women are the primary or sole breadwinners for nearly half of all households of color, these disparities do not just affect them, but their families and communities as well.
<br><br>
Further, as President Obama recently noted, women of color “struggle every day with biases that perpetuate oppressive standards for how they’re supposed to look and how they’re supposed to act. Too often, they’re either left under the hard light of scrutiny, or cloaked in a kind of invisibility.” When addressing the challenges women and girls of color face C challenges that often lie at the intersection of race and gender C we often fail to fully acknowledge, and account for, this complexity.<br><br>

President Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls in the first months of his presidency precisely for the purpose of addressing issues like these. The Council’s mandate is to ensure that every agency, department and office in the federal government takes into account the needs and aspirations of women and girls in every aspect of their work. Since it was established, the Council has worked on a number of issues and policies that impact women and girls of color across the country. Highlights of these initiatives C as well as numerous others across the federal government C are detailed in this report.<br><br>

In detailing both the progress we have made and the challenges that still remain, this Report should serve both as a reminder of what is possible and as a call to action to do so much more.
<br><br>
Looking Ahead:<br><br>

*As part of its efforts to address barriers and disparities that still exist for so many Americans and so many women and girls of color in particular, the Council is convening a Working Group on Challenges and Opportunities for Women and Girls of Color.  This Working Group will bring together policy staff from the White House and across federal agencies C as well as experts, leaders and advocates from outside the government C to focus on issues including education, economic security, health, criminal and juvenile justice, violence, and research and data collection.   More information on the Working Group will be released at a later date.
 <br><br>
*Consistent with President Obama’s commitment to ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed, in January, 2015, the Department of Education, the White House Domestic Policy Council, the White House Council on Women and Girls and Georgetown University will convene thought leaders, policy makers, practitioners, researchers, advocates, and marginalized girls and young women to focus on increasing access to STEM and CTE opportunities. We will address barriers to access, including cultural competency, race and gender stereotypes, discrimination, and lack of sufficient resources to support programs in schools and communities. This convening will produce and inform policy and programmatic proposals to help disrupt patterns of gender-based occupational segregation by increasing young women’s and girls’ participation in programs that prepare them for high-skill, high-wage jobs, including non-traditional occupations. The aim is to develop a strategy to prepare students for in-demand careers in high-growth industry sectors.

Strengthening Bilateral Relations<br><br>

President Obama and President Xi announced the reciprocal extension of the validity of short- term business and tourist visas from one to ten years, and of student visas from one year to five years.  This arrangement will facilitate the travel of millions of U.S. and Chinese citizens, furthering the trade, cultural, and people-to-people ties that form the foundation of our bilateral relationship.  In 2013, close to 2 million Chinese citizens traveled to the United States and contributed $21.1 billion to the U.S. economy; this is expected to grow to nearly $85 billion a year by 2021 with this announcement.<br><br>

The United States and China agreed to military-to-military confidence-building mechanisms (CBM) in the following areas: 1) Notification of Major Military Activities, with annexes on notification of policy and strategy developments, and observation of military exercises and activities, and 2) Rules of Behavior for the Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters, with annexes on terms of reference and rules of behavior for encounters between naval surface vessels.  Together, these CBMs increase transparency and predictability and reduce risk of unintended incidents.  Both sides commit to further develop both CBMs.  The United States will prioritize completing a mechanism for informing the other party of ballistic missile launches as an annex to the Notification of Major Military Activities mechanism.  On the Rules of Behavior for the Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters CBM, the United States will prioritize developing an annex on air-air encounters.
<br><br>
President Obama and President Xi agree to work on expanding law enforcement cooperation in the following areas: enhancing coordination and cooperation on repatriation and fugitive issues, increasing law enforcement cooperation on counterfeit goods, stemming the flow of improvised explosive devices, and fighting corruption and transnational crime.  The two leaders highlighted Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson’s anticipated travel to China in 2015 as an opportunity for our countries to explore specific proposals for further cooperation.

FACT SHEET: The Obama Administration Continues its Commitment to Veterans, Service Members, and Military Families
On this Veteran’s Day, as we pause to thank the men and women who keep America free, the Administration is redoubling our efforts to serve those that serve us, not only by ensuring that our veterans get the benefits they have earned, but by expanding opportunity for those who sacrifice so much to serve our country: our service members, veterans and their families.<br><br>

During his annual address to Veteran Service Organizations at the American Legion National Convention, President Obama outlined this Administration’s  five priorities for fulfilling our promises to all those who have served: ensuring the VA has the resources our veterans deserve; delivering the health care veterans have been promised; ending the disability claims backlog; protecting the dignity and rights of all veterans; and making sure all veterans have every opportunity to pursue the American Dream. <br><br>

The Department of Veterans Affairs has made significant progress already through Secretary Bob McDonald’s Road to Veterans Day plan, the roadmap for his first 90 days. We will continue to build on this foundation to improve service delivery, rebuild trust with veterans, and set the course for long term reform.
<br><br>
Ensuring the Department of Veterans Affairs Has the Resources to Serve Our Veterans
<br><br>
Over the past five years, the Administration has made more benefits and opportunities available to more veterans than ever before.   Funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs is at its highest level ever, having increased 33 percent during the President’s tenure.  For the first time in history, beginning in FY 2011, continuity of care for our veterans has been guaranteed, with more than $55 billion in advance appropriations provided in FY 2015 for VA medical programs to ensure that manufactured crises in Washington don’t disrupt care for our veterans. 
<br><br>
Delivering the Health Care Veterans Have Been Promised
<br><br>
VA has made significant progress in accelerating care to veterans and addressing instances of unacceptable wait-times.  To improve service delivery, VA has prioritized efforts to get Veterans off of wait lists and into clinics through the Accelerated Care Initiative.  As part of this initiative, VA medical centers have increased access to care inside and outside of VA, added more clinic hours and work days, deployed mobile medical units, and shared their best practices from VA’s high-performing facilities throughout the organization.  Significant improvements have resulted nationally over the past four months:
<br><br>
*VA medical centers have scheduled 1.2 million more appointments than during the same period last year<br><br>
*Reduced the national primary care wait time by 18 percent<br><br>
*Completed 98 percent of appointments within 30 days of the veterans’ preferred date, or the date determined to be medically necessary by a physician<br><br>
*From June to October 1, 2014, VA has authorized 1.1 million non-VA care authorizations, a 47 percent increase over the same period last year. <br><br>
To respond to veterans’ mental health needs, and in response to the President’s Executive Order, VA has also substantially increased mental health staffing, expanded the capacity of the Veterans Crisis Line by 50%, and enhanced its partnerships with community mental health providers.  In August, the President announced 19 new executive actions to continue to improve the mental health of service members, veterans, and their families.<br><br>

Ending the Disability Claims Backlog<br><br>

The Obama Administration is paying the largest number of veteran disability claims in the history of our country.  By partnering with Veteran Service Organizations to systematically reduce the benefits claims backlog, we have reduced it by more than 60 percent since its peak in March 2013 and we are on track to eliminate the backlog completely in 2015.
<br><br>
Protecting the Dignity and Rights of All Veterans<br><br>

President Obama has presided over the steepest decline in veterans’ homelessness in history.  For the first time, ending homelessness among veterans is a federal policy priority, backed by a coordinated interagency effort that is yielding concrete results:<br><br>

*Since 2010, overall homelessness among veterans is down 33 percent and unsheltered veteran homelessness is down 43 percent.  This means that on any given night, there are 25,000 fewer veterans on the streets or in shelters. 
*Answering the President’s call to action, more than 250 mayors, governors, and county executives have committed to end veteran homelessness in their communities. <br><br>
The President has proposed an expansion of tax credits for private firms hiring disabled veterans.  He has also expanded consumer protections for veterans, and provided compensation for service members and combat veterans who were wrongfully foreclosed upon while deployed in defense of our nation. <br><br> 

Making Sure All Veterans Have Every Opportunity to Pursue the American Dream<br><br>

The Administration oversaw and ensured adequate resources for the successful implementation of the Post 9-11 GI Bill .  Since the inception of Post-9/11 GI Bill , VA has issued more than $46.2 billion in Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit payments to over 1.3 million individuals.  By 2014, over 790,000 were using the Post-9/11 GI Bill , almost 2 times the number of all education benefit beneficiaries in 2000 (397,000). <br><br>

We have seen strong improvement in employment for veterans.  The 12 month average of the unemployment rate for veterans has fallen by over a third since its peak, decreasing from a high of 8.7 percent to 5.6 percent today.  In addition, the 12 month average of the unemployment rate for Post-9/11 veterans has been reduced by over a third since its high in December 2011.  However, as with our wider veterans population, there remains work to do with ensuring Post-9/11 veterans find quality jobs.  Post-9/11 veterans are still unemployed at higher rates than similar non-veteran individuals, and we need to keep working to close that gap. <br><br>

The Obama Administration also has the highest number of veterans working in the Executive Branch since the mid-1970s.  Since the President created the Council on Veterans Employment in Executive Order 13518 in November 2009, the percentage of veterans hired by the Executive Branch has steadily increased from 24 percent in FY 2009 to 31 percent in FY 2013.
<br><br>
Finally, the Administration has worked to help veterans transition into licensed careers in their preferred state once their service has concluded, and to help licensed military spouses continue their careers when a service member’s family is relocated.  As a result, the Administration has overseen the largest expansion of occupational licensing portability for service members and their spouses in history.  Working in close partnership with state policy makers and Veteran Service Organizations, 48 States now support some form of expedited portability. 
<br><br>
Supporting Families of Veterans and Service Members<br><br>

This Administration is supporting the families of military members and veterans in an unprecedented way.  In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families, and to support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities.  Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to help provide service members, veterans, and their families with the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives.
<br><br>
*Employment:  Through the Military Spouse Employment Partnership more than 60,000 military spouses have been hired by 220 private- and public-sector partners since the program launched, and more than 540,000 veterans and military spouses have been hired in the past three years through Joining Forces Companies responding to the President’s call to action to hire.
*Education:  More than 100 colleges and universities have signed on to “Educate the Educators”, the Joining Forces commitment that will help prepare educators to lead classrooms and develop school cultures that are more responsive to the social, emotional, and academic needs of children in military families.<br><br>
*Wellness:  Through the American Associations of Colleges of Nursing more than 150 state and national nursing organizations and over 650 nursing schools have committed to prepare the nation’s nursing workforce to meet the unique health needs of service members, veterans, and their families by educating the current and future nurses of America to have a better understanding of PTSD and TBI.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">Net Neutrality</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
<a href= "link06.html">是那些人主宰美国</a><br><br>
	
November 10, 2014 <br><br>
Statement by the President on Net Neutrality<br><br>
An open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life.  By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known.
<br><br>
“Net neutrality” has been built into the fabric of the Internet since its creation ― but it is also a principle that we cannot take for granted.  We cannot allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas.  That is why today, I am asking the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to answer the call of almost 4 million public comments, and implement the strongest possible rules to protect net neutrality.
<br><br>
When I was a candidate for this office, I made clear my commitment to a free and open Internet, and my commitment remains as strong as ever.  Four years ago, the FCC tried to implement rules that would protect net neutrality with little to no impact on the telecommunications companies that make important investments in our economy.  After the rules were challenged, the court reviewing the rules agreed with the FCC that net neutrality was essential for preserving an environment that encourages new investment in the network, new online services and content, and everything else that makes up the Internet as we now know it.  Unfortunately, the court ultimately struck down the rules ― not because it disagreed with the need to protect net neutrality, but because it believed the FCC had taken the wrong legal approach. 
<br><br>
The FCC is an independent agency, and ultimately this decision is theirs alone.  I believe the FCC should create a new set of rules protecting net neutrality and ensuring that neither the cable company nor the phone company will be able to act as a gatekeeper, restricting what you can do or see online.  The rules I am asking for are simple, common-sense steps that reflect the Internet you and I use every day, and that some ISPs already observe.  These bright-line rules include:
<br><br>
*No blocking.  If a consumer requests access to a website or service, and the content is legal, your ISP should not be permitted to block it.  That way, every player ― not just those commercially affiliated with an ISP ― gets a fair shot at your business.<br><br>
*No throttling.  Nor should ISPs be able to intentionally slow down some content or speed up others ― through a process often called “throttling” ― based on the type of service or your ISP’s preferences.<br><br>
*Increased transparency.  The connection between consumers and ISPs ― the so-called “last mile” ― is not the only place some sites might get special treatment.  So, I am also asking the FCC to make full use of the transparency authorities the court recently upheld, and if necessary to apply net neutrality rules to points of interconnection between the ISP and the rest of the Internet.<br><br>
*No paid prioritization.  Simply put: No service should be stuck in a “slow lane” because it does not pay a fee.  That kind of gatekeeping would undermine the level playing field essential to the Internet’s growth.  So, as I have before, I am asking for an explicit ban on paid prioritization and any other restriction that has a similar effect.<br><br>
If carefully designed, these rules should not create any undue burden for ISPs, and can have clear, monitored exceptions for reasonable network management and for specialized services such as dedicated, mission-critical networks serving a hospital.  But combined, these rules mean everything for preserving the Internet’s openness.<br><br>

The rules also have to reflect the way people use the Internet today, which increasingly means on a mobile device.  I believe the FCC should make these rules fully applicable to mobile broadband as well, while recognizing the special challenges that come with managing wireless networks. <br><br>

To be current, these rules must also build on the lessons of the past.  For almost a century, our law has recognized that companies who connect you to the world have special obligations not to exploit the monopoly they enjoy over access in and out of your home or business.  That is why a phone call from a customer of one phone company can reliably reach a customer of a different one, and why you will not be penalized solely for calling someone who is using another provider.  It is common sense that the same philosophy should guide any service that is based on the transmission of information ― whether a phone call, or a packet of data.<br><br>

So the time has come for the FCC to recognize that broadband service is of the same importance and must carry the same obligations as so many of the other vital services do.  To do that, I believe the FCC should reclassify consumer broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act ― while at the same time forbearing from rate regulation and other provisions less relevant to broadband services.  This is a basic acknowledgment of the services ISPs provide to American homes and businesses, and the straightforward obligations necessary to ensure the network works for everyone ― not just one or two companies.<br><br>

Investment in wired and wireless networks has supported jobs and made America the center of a vibrant ecosystem of digital devices, apps, and platforms that fuel growth and expand opportunity. Importantly, network investment remained strong under the previous net neutrality regime, before it was struck down by the court; in fact, the court agreed that protecting net neutrality helps foster more investment and innovation.  If the FCC appropriately forbears from the Title II regulations that are not needed to implement the principles above ― principles that most ISPs have followed for years ― it will help ensure new rules are consistent with incentives for further investment in the infrastructure of the Internet.
<br><br>
The Internet has been one of the greatest gifts our economy ― and our society ― has ever known.  The FCC was chartered to promote competition, innovation, and investment in our networks.  In service of that mission, there is no higher calling than protecting an open, accessible, and free Internet.  I thank the Commissioners for having served this cause with distinction and integrity, and I respectfully ask them to adopt the policies I have outlined here, to preserve this technology’s promise for today, and future generations to come.

FACT SHEET: Supporting American Job Growth And Strengthening Ties By Extending U.S./China Visa Validity for Tourists, Business Travelers, and Students<br><br>
Today, President Obama announced that the United States and the People’s Republic of China are concluding a reciprocal visa validity arrangement during his visit that will strengthen our ever-broadening economic and people-to-people ties.  Both countries have agreed to increase the validity of short-term tourist and business visas issued to each other’s citizens from one to ten years C the longest validity possible under U.S. law C and increase the validity of student and exchange visas from one to five years.  The United States will begin issuing visas in accordance with the new reciprocal agreement on November 12, 2014.<br><br>

This arrangement will improve trade, investment, and business ties by facilitating travel and offering easier access to both economies.  Extended validity visas for students and exchange visitors will boost the bonds between our two peoples and facilitate travel for outstanding students from around the world who attend U.S. institutions of higher education.  As a result of this arrangement, the United States hopes to welcome a growing share of eligible Chinese travelers, inject billions in the U.S. economy and create enough demand to support hundreds of thousands of additional U.S. jobs.  Travelers will continue to be subject to all the same legal and security reviews that currently apply to visa applicants. 
<br><br>
*Welcoming a Growing Share of Chinese Travelers. <br><br>
~China is the fastest-growing outbound tourism market in the world, and in 2013, 1.8 million Chinese travelers visited the United States, contributing $21.1 billion to the U.S. economy and supporting more than 109,000 American jobs.
~Chinese travelers consistently rank the United States as their most-desired travel destination, yet less than 2 percent of total Chinese travelers come to the United States.<br><br>
~Chinese travelers cite ease of visa policies as the second most important factor in deciding where to travel, behind only cost.<br><br>
~A competitive visa policy will help us meet projections that suggest as many as 7.3 million Chinese travelers will come to the United States by 2021, contributing nearly $85 billion a year to the economy and supporting up to 440,000 U.S. jobs.<br><br>
*Strengthening Bonds Between Chinese and American Students. <br><br>
~28 percent of all foreign students and exchange visitors in the United States originate from China.<br><br>
~Chinese students in the United States spent $8 billion in 2013, an increase of nearly 24 percent over the previous year.<br><br>
~Today’s arrangement will allow American and Chinese students to more easily travel back and forth, making foreign study a more attractive option, increasing opportunities for people-to-people ties, and boosting mutual understanding.<br><br>
 

Extending Visa Validity to Increase the Number of Chinese Travelers Coming to the United States and Support American Jobs
<br><br>
Today, the President is taking action to welcome more Chinese visitors to the United States, in order to support America’s most important and largest services export C tourism.  Chinese travelers persistently rank the United States as their top desired travel destination, but only slightly more than 1.8 percent of total outbound travelers go to the United States.  Chinese travelers cite ease of visa policies as the second most important factor in deciding where to travel, behind only cost.  A competitive visa policy is needed to secure our place as the chosen destination for millions of Chinese travelers.<br><br>

*Travel and tourism is a major driver of the U.S. economy and we have made significant progress in improving our visa processing.  In 2013, nearly 70 million international travelers visited the United States, experiencing all that America has to offer from our cities to our many national parks. Those visits support nearly 1.1 million American jobs C including thousands at local and small businesses.  Growth in international visitors has created roughly 260,000 American jobs over the past five years alone. The Administration has taken steps to support this impressive growth, including improving visa processing waiting periods in important markets like China where they have dropped from as high as several months to less than five days on average. In total, the State Department issued 9.2 million visas worldwide in 2013, up 42 percent since 2010.<br><br>
*Global growth of outbound travel from China represents an unprecedented opportunity to foster job creation across the country.  China is the fastest growing outbound tourism market in the world, and Chinese visitors have accounted for 20 percent of the growth in overseas travel to the United States since 2008.  In 2013, 1.8 million Chinese travelers visited the United States, contributing $21.1 billion to the U.S. economy and supporting more than 109,000 U.S. jobs.  As incomes in China continue to rise, the number of Chinese citizens able to afford international travel and tourism is projected to more than double over the next few years, reaching the hundreds of millions.  Close to 7.3 million Chinese are projected to travel to the United States by 2021, contributing nearly $85 billion a year to the economy and supporting 440,000 jobs. But if our visa policy were allowed to fall behind other countries, we might miss out on much of this additional economic activity.<br><br>
*The United States must continue to maintain a competitive advantage in the global business arena. Extending visa validity will bring the United States into line or surpass other destinations that have already eased visa restrictions for Chinese travelers such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan.  The European Commission, France, Germany, and Italy are also taking steps to extend visa validity to Chinese travelers.  Today’s announcement will allow more Chinese to make the United States their destination of choice.<br><br>
*Increasing business travel will support the President’s goal of increasing exports. Increasing visa validity for U.S. citizens traveling to China makes it easier to respond to market and commercial opportunities in China, helping to boost U.S. exports, foster increased trade ties, and improve commercial linkages between U.S. and Chinese firms.  In the near term, extending visa validity for Chinese business travelers will also help meet the President’s SelectUSA goal of boosting inward investment into the United States as the U.S. travel and tourism industry commits to making upfront investments in new hotels and other infrastructure in anticipation of a rise in Chinese inbound travel.<br><br>
Strengthening Tourism and Education Opportunities by Enhancing Student Visas<br><br>

Chinese student and exchange visitors represent 30 percent of all such visas issued worldwide, with Chinese nationals comprising the largest group of foreign students in the United States.  Students, exchange visitors, and their dependents may now receive multiple-entry visas valid for up to five years, depending on their program.  This will allow American and Chinese students to more easily travel back and forth, making foreign study a more attractive option, increasing opportunities for people-to-people ties, and boosting mutual understanding.

Remarks by President Obama and President Xi Jinping in Joint Press Conference <br><br>
Great Hall of the People<br><br>
Beijing, China<br><br>

12:17 P.M. CST<br><br>

PRESIDENT XI:  (As interpreted.)  Honorable President Obama, distinguished guests, dear friends from the press, good morning.  First of all, I wish to once again warmly welcome President Obama to China for this state visit.
<br><br>
Over the past two days, I had a constructive and productive discussion with President Obama.  We had sincere and in-depth exchange of views, and reached broad agreement on China-U.S. relations, major international, and regional issues of shared interest, as well as on global issues.
<br><br>
We reaffirmed the agreement that we reached at the Annenberg estate on developing the bilateral relations.  We agreed to continue to advance the development of a new model of major-country relations between China and the United States.  We had in-depth discussions on the priority areas for advancing such relationship.  We agreed to accelerate the negotiations of the BIT, and we’ll make efforts to reach agreement on the core issues and the major articles of the treaty text, and to initiate the negative list of negotiations in 2015.<br><br>

We have reached agreement on the ITA expansion negotiations, and we are ready to work together for the early conclusion of relevant plural-lateral talks.  We fully recognize the document signed between the two departments of defense on building two major confidence-building measures, and agreed to continue to deepen military exchanges, mutual trust and cooperation on that basis, and develop a new type of military-to-military relations between the two countries.
<br><br>
We issued a joint statement on climate change, and we jointly announced our respective post-2020 targets.  We agreed to make sure that international climate change negotiations will reach an agreement as scheduled at the Paris conference in 2015, and we agreed to deepen practical cooperation on clean energy, environment protection, and other areas.
<br><br>
We reaffirmed our firm opposition to terrorism of all forms, and agreed to strengthen counterterrorism cooperation on intelligence sharing, terrorist financing, and cyber-terrorism.  And we will work together to remove the threats of various terrorists and extremist forces.<br><br>

We agreed to make use of such channels as a meeting between the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to have further discussions on law enforcement cooperation, which includes cracking down on transnational crimes, fugitives hunting, and recovery of criminal proceeds.
<br><br>
We have reached reciprocal arrangements on the visa for business travelers, tourists and students.  We have agreed to issue 10-year, multiple-entry visas for respective business travelers and tourists, and 5-year, multiple-entry visas for each other's students.  This will greatly promote people-to-people exchanges between our two countries and will help to promote our exchange and cooperation in the various fields, and promote the long-term development of bilateral relations.
<br><br>
We agreed to follow such principles as mutual respect, seeking common ground while sharing differences, exchanges and mutual learning, and manage our differences on sensitive issues in a constructive way so as to ensure the healthy and steady growth of the bilateral ties.
<br><br>
I told President Obama that China has proposed the Asian security concept at the CICA summit here in May in order to encourage Asian countries to view common security in an inclusive and cooperative spirit.  At the same time, I also said that the Pacific Ocean is broad enough to accommodate the development of both China and the United States, and our two countries to work together to contribute to security in Asia.
<br><br>
These are mutually complementary efforts instead of mutually exclusive ones.  China and the U.S. should continue to enhance dialogue and coordination on Asia Pacific affairs, and respect and accommodate each other’s interests and concerns in this region, and develop inclusive coordination.
<br><br>
I also introduced to President Obama China’s initiatives of establishing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund.  Underdeveloped infrastructure is the main bottleneck obstructing the economic development in Asia.  China has initiated the AIIB in order to offer support and facility to regional infrastructure development.  These proposals and initiatives are open and inclusive in Asia; they are not exclusive.  We welcome the active participation of the United States and other relevant countries so that together we can promote and share prosperity and peace in Asia Pacific.
<br><br>
We recognize the positive actions both have taken in helping African countries affected by the Ebola virus to fight against the disease.  We indicated that, based on the actual needs of African countries, we will leverage our respective strength and work with the rest of the international community to help affected countries to strengthen capacity-building on health and epidemic prevention so as to place the epidemic under control as soon as possible.
<br><br>
I thank President Obama and the U.S. team for their support to China’s hosting of the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting.  Both are willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation on multilateral forums, including APEC and G-20, and to play a positive role in promoting global economic recovery and development.
<br><br>
China and the United States have worked closely on the negotiations of the Iranian nuclear issue, and we hope that relevant parties would persist in consensus, address differences, and make political decisions so as to promote the early conclusion of a win-win and comprehensive agreement.  China is firmly committed to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.  We intend -- we should address the Korean Peninsula issue through dialogue and negotiations.  The relevant parties should have active contact and dialogue so as to create conditions for the early launch -- for re-launch of the Six Party Talks.
<br><br>
And the two sides also agreed to continue their exchange on the cooperation on the Afghan issue.
<br><br>
Ladies and gentlemen, friends, China is ready to work with the United States to make efforts in a number of priority areas and putting into effect such principles as non-confrontation, non-conflict, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation.  And with unwavering spirit and unremitting efforts, we will promote new progress in building a new type model of major-country relations between the two countries so as to bring greater benefits to our two peoples and two countries.
<br><br>
Thank you.
<br><br>
MODERATOR:  Thank you, President Xi.  I now give the floor to President Obama.
<br><br>
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, thank you, President Xi, for welcoming me and my delegation to Beijing and for the extraordinary hospitality that you and the Chinese people have shown to me on this state visit.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank the people of China for the warmth and kindness they showed my wife Michelle and our daughters, as well as my mother-in-law when they came to visit China earlier this year -- another sign of the enduring friendship between our peoples.<br><br>

This year marks the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations.  I’m told that Deng Xiaoping said that we must “seek truth from facts.”  On this anniversary, it is a fact that the past three and a half decades have seen an extraordinary growth in the ties between our two countries -- more trade, more collaborations between our businesses and scientists and researchers, more connections between the Chinese and the American people, from tourists to our students.  And it is a fact that when we work together, it’s good for the United States, it's good for China, and it is good for the world.
<br><br>
As I’ve said many times, the United States welcomes the continuing rise of a China that is peaceful, prosperous and stable and that plays a responsible role in the world.  And we don’t just welcome it, we support it.  For decades, America’s engagement in the Asia Pacific, including our alliances and our stabilizing presence, have been a foundation for the region’s progress, including contributing to China’s remarkable economic growth.  The United States has worked to expand trade and investment with China, and to help integrate China into the global economy.  And we want that progress to continue because, as I said before, it benefits all of us.
<br><br>
I believe that President Xi and I have a common understanding about how the relationship between our nations can move forward.  We agree that we can expand our cooperation where our interests overlap or align.  When we have disagreements, we will be candid and clear about our intentions, and we will work to narrow those differences where possible.  Even as we compete and disagree in some areas, I believe we can continue to advance the security and prosperity of our people and people around the world.  That’s my vision for how we can develop the relationship between our countries.  That’s the vision that we’ve advanced during this visit, which has taken our bilateral, regional and global cooperation to a new level.  And I want to thank President Xi for his leadership in fostering that kind of atmosphere of cooperation.
<br><br>
First, President Xi and I agreed on the importance of continuing to exercise -- to increase the trade that helps grow our economies and creates jobs.  More U.S. exports to a growing China means more opportunities for American businesses, workers and farmers.  We agreed to work actively on a comprehensive bilateral investment treaty with high standards.  And that provides the opportunity for Chinese businesses to invest in the United States, as well as opening up the opportunity for more U.S. businesses to invest here in China, creating jobs for both our countries.
<br><br>
We reached an understanding that will allow us to work with other nations to conclude the Information Technology Agreement, which will help us boost trade in the computer and IT products that power the 21st century economy.  We agreed to work together to promote innovation in agricultural and food security to help feed a growing planet.  And our agreement to extend visas for business people, tourists and students will help fuel growth and create jobs for Americans and Chinese.
<br><br>
I told President Xi that we welcome reforms being discussed here that would give the market a defining role in the Chinese economy.  At the same time, I did emphasize the need for a level playing field, so foreign companies can compete fairly, including against Chinese state-owned enterprises.  I stressed the importance of protecting intellectual property as well as trade secrets, especially against cyber-threats.  And we welcome continued progress towards a market-driven exchange rate.<br><br>

Second, as the world’s two largest economies, energy consumers and emitters of greenhouse gases, we have a special responsibility to lead the global effort against climate change.  That's why today I am proud that we can announce a historic agreement.  I commend President Xi, his team, and the Chinese government for the commitment they are making to slow, peak, and then reverse the course of China’s carbon emissions.
<br><br>
Today, I can also announce that the United States has set a new goal of reducing our net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025.  This is an ambitious goal, but it is an achievable goal.  It will double the pace at which we’re reducing carbon pollution in the United States.  It puts us on a path to achieving the deep emissions reductions by advanced economies that the scientific community says is necessary to prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change.  It will help improve public health.  It will grow our economy.  It will create jobs.  It will strengthen our energy security, and it will put both of our nations on the path to a low-carbon economy.
<br><br>
This is a major milestone in the U.S.-China relationship, and it shows what’s possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge.  In addition, by making this announcement today, together, we hope to encourage all major economies to be ambitious -- all countries, developing and developed -- to work across some of the old divides so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement next year.   
<br><br>
Third, with respect to regional security, we agreed to a number of new measures to improve communications between our militaries in order to reduce the risk of accidents or miscalculations on the seas and in the air.  President Xi and I reaffirmed our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and we agree that North Korea will not succeed in pursuing nuclear weapons and economic development, that it can’t have both.
<br><br>
While the United States does not take a position on competing claims in the East and South China Seas, I made it clear that we do have a fundamental interest in freedom of navigation, and that territorial disputes in the region should be resolved peacefully, in accordance with international law.  And I congratulated President Xi on the initial contacts with Prime Minister Abe of Japan to help lower tensions with respect to that issue.
<br><br>
I reaffirmed my strong commitment to our One-China policy based on the Three Joint Communiqués and the Taiwan Relations Act.  And we encourage further progress by both sides of the Taiwan Strait towards building ties, reducing tensions and promoting stability on the basis of dignity and respect, which is in the interest of both sides, as well as the region and the United States.
<br><br>
Fourth, I welcomed China’s contributions to international security.  This includes our mutual support for a stable, unified Afghanistan; our mutual interest in seeing the terrorist group ISIL is destroyed; the potential work we can do together in other counterterrorism activities, including those that were raised by President Xi; our mutual efforts as part of the P5-plus-1 to reach a comprehensive solution that ensures Iran’s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.
<br><br>
We agree that Iran should seize this historic opportunity by making the tough choices that are necessary to achieve a lasting diplomatic solution.  And in addition, the United States is very appreciative of China’s important contributions in West Africa in the fight against Ebola.  We agreed to expand our cooperation against infectious diseases more broadly and to promote access to electricity across Africa -- more examples of the difference we can make when we work together.
<br><br>
And finally, I reiterated to President Xi, as I have before, that America’s unwavering support for fundamental human rights of all people will continue to be an important element of our relationship with China, just as it is with all the countries that we interact with around the world.  And we had a very healthy exchange around these issues.  President Xi gave me his sense of how China is moving forward.  I described to him by it is so important for us to speak out for the freedoms that we believe are universal, rights that we believe are the birthright of all men and women, wherever they live, whether it is in New York or Paris or Hong Kong.
<br><br>
We think history shows that nations that uphold these rights -- including for ethnic and religious minorities -- are ultimately more prosperous, more successful, and more able to achieve the dreams of their people.  In that context, I did note that we recognize Tibet as part of the People’s Republic of China.  We are not in favor of independence.  But we did encourage Chinese authorities to take steps to preserve the unique cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.
<br><br>
In closing, I want to say that I am pleased that we continue to expand the ties between our peoples.  The new visa extension that begins today will bring more Chinese tourists to the United States and more American tourists to see the magnificent sights of China.  That will encourage more exchanges among our students.  We welcome more Chinese students to the United States than from any other country.  And I’m proud that this summer my “100,000 Strong” program reached our goal of more than 100,000 Americans studying in China in recent years.  With these visa extensions, we’ll give more students this opportunity -- both Chinese and Americans.
<br><br>
So every day, our people are coming to know each other better.  Every day, our young people are forging friendships that will serve our countries for many decades to come.  Every day some of the barriers of mistrust are broken down, mutual understanding is promoted.  And that lays the seeds for cooperation, not just today, but for future generations.
<br><br>
So, President Xi, thank you again for your hospitality, for the candid and very productive conversations, for your hosting of an excellent APEC Summit, and for our work together.
<br><br>
As Deng Xiaoping said, we must seek facts from -- “seek truth from facts.”  The truth is that we have made important progress today for the benefit of both of our nations and for the benefit of the world.  The truth is that even more progress is possible as we continue to develop this important relationship.  I am confident that we will be able to do so.  So thank you.  Xie xie. 
<br><br>
We’ve each agreed I believe to take a question from the press.
<br><br>
MODERATOR:  Thank you both presidents.  Now the two presidents have agreed to each take a question from the press.  Now, first President Obama will take a question from a member of the American press.
<br><br>
MR. EARNEST:  The first question will be from Mark Landler of The New York Times.
<br><br>
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Where's Mark?  There he is.
<br><br>
Q  Thank you very much, President Xi and President Obama.  My first question is to President Obama.  You’ve spoken a lot over the past few days about the potential of China as a partner for the United States and have concluded several agreements this week that attest to that.  At the same time, there has been a surge of anti-American rhetoric in China in recent weeks, particularly in the state media.  Chinese newspapers have disparaged your leadership style and have fueled speculation that the United States is a black hand behind the protests in Hong Kong.  My question is whether you’re concerned that this anti-American rhetoric could impede the kind of collaboration that you wish to have with China.  And to what do you attribute that?
<br><br>
And if I may, because I want to make sure I grab my chance with the President of China, ask a couple of questions of him.  Mr. President, President Obama has sketched out a strategic pivot to Asia that includes shoring up alliances with American allies like Japan and South Korea, deploying Marines to Australia, negotiating a regional trade pact that at the moment excludes China, and speaking up -- as he did just a moment ago -- on territorial disputes between China and its neighbors.  Several months ago in Shanghai at a conference, you said it is for the Asians to run the affairs of Asia.  I wonder whether you’re concerned that this strategic pivot represents an effort to contain China.
<br><br>
And then if I may, lastly, on a parochial issue --
<br><br>
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Come on, Mark.
<br><br>
Q  On a parochial issue -- several news organizations from the United States have had issues with residency permits in China being denied, including The New York Times.  I’m wondering in the spirit of these reciprocal visa arrangements that you’ve agreed to this week with business people and students, isn’t it time to extend that sort of right to foreign correspondents who seek to cover your country?
<br><br>
Thank you both very much.
<br><br>
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I’m not sure I remember the question.  (Laughter.)  I’m teasing.
<br><br>
First of all, with respect to press attitudes towards America or me in particular, I am always working on the assumption that the press giving me a hard time is true wherever I go, whether in the United States or China.  That’s part of being a public official.  And I think that it is fair to say that there are differences between the United States and China on a range of issues.  On the other end, I’m a big believer in actions and not words.  And this summit I think is evidence of the values that China places in the relationship between the United States and China.
<br><br>
On a whole host of issues at this summit, we’ve shown that U.S.-China cooperation can end up not only being good for the two countries, but for the world as a whole.  And I do think that one of the benefits of a summit like this is an opportunity for one-on-one conversations between the leaders of the two countries to break down some of the misperceptions and mistrust that can build up over time.
<br><br>
So, for example, on the issue of Hong Kong, which did come up in our conversations, I was unequivocal in saying to President Xi that the United States had no involvement in fostering the protests that took place there; that these are issues ultimately for the people of Hong Kong and the people of China to decide.  But I did describe for him that the United States, as a matter of foreign policy but also a matter of our values, are going to consistently speak out on the right of people to express themselves, and encourage the elections that take place in Hong Kong are transparent and fair and reflective of the opinions of people there.
<br><br>
And more broadly, our conversations gave me an opportunity to debunk the notion that you suggested, Mark, just now that our pivot to Asia is about containing China.  I have repeatedly reiterated and displayed through the actions of our administration that we want China to succeed.  And we actively encourage our friends and allies in the region to foster a strong and cooperative relationship with China.
<br><br>
So, as I mentioned briefly, we applaud the lowering of tensions between China and Japan.  We think that’s good for the region and good for both countries.  And so what you left out of the list of actions that we’ve taken in this pivot to Asia is the multiple meetings I’ve had with President Xi and his predecessor, and the remarkable scope of agreements that we have reached to deepen economic, scientific, educational and security arrangements between the United States and China.
<br><br>
In other words, a strong, cooperative relationship with China is at the heart of our pivot to Asia.  And if the United States is going to continue to lead the world in addressing global challenges, then we have to have the second-largest economy and the most populous nation on Earth as our partner.  And the carbon reduction agreement that we just announced is a perfect example of why a strong U.S.-China relationship is so critical.
<br><br>
And just in closing, I want to say that although there are going to continue to be tensions and disagreements between our countries, as is true with all countries, particularly large countries that have a lot of interests around the globe, I’ve consistently found President Xi to be willing to engage on those differences in a frank and candid matter, and we have consistently strived to find ways to narrow those differences.
<br><br>
I think the military-to-military cooperation announcements that we’re making today are a perfect example of how rather than try to tamp down those differences, surfacing them and then addressing them is going to be a centerpiece, a lynchpin for the kinds of cooperative agreements that I hope will continue for generations to come.
<br><br>
MODERATOR:  Now, President Xi Jinping will take a question from a member of the Chinese press.  China Daily, please.
<br><br>
Q  (As interpreted.)  China Daily.  The world is watching very closely today's summit meeting between you, President Xi, and President Obama.  And the China-U.S. relationship has gone beyond the bilateral scope.  It is increasingly consequential for the whole world and for this region.  As China further develops, how does China see its own position and role in international affairs?
<br><br>
PRESIDENT XI:  (As interpreted.)  Thank you for your question.  There are very wide areas where China and the United States need to and can cooperate with each other.  And as the international situation continues to experience complex, fluid and profound changes, there will be even more areas where our two countries need to work together.
<br><br>
In recent years, China and the United States worked together to counter the impact of the global financial crisis.  We have also worked together to try and resolve some regional hotspot issues, such as the Korean nuclear issue, the Iranian nuclear issue, the situation in Syria and so on, through dialogue.  We've also partnered with each other to address some serious challenges, including climate change, terrorism, and the Ebola epidemic.
<br><br>
The strategic significance of China-U.S. relations is on the rise.  China is a participant in, builder of, and contributor to the international system.  China's economic development is in itself an important contribution to the global efforts to address the international financial crisis and to promote the recovery and the growth of the world economy.
<br><br>
China has sent more personnel to U.N. peacekeeping missions than any other permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.  To date, we have sent over 20,000 of our military personnel to various U.N. peacekeeping operations.  And the Chinese navy has combatted 45 escort missions in the piracy-ridden waters of the Gulf of Aden.  And China is firm in opposing all forms of terrorism, and we have all along been supportive of international cooperation to fight terrorism.
<br><br>
The Chinese people empathize with the Western African countries that are experiencing the Ebola epidemic.  We have so far provided four tranches of assistance that is worth 750 million RMB.  And even as we speak, there are over 300 Chinese medical personnel working on the ground in Africa to help the affected areas.
<br><br>
As China continues to develop, we will shoulder more and more international responsibilities that are commensurate with our own strengths and position.  We will remain firmly committed to working with other countries to share China's development opportunity and to address various challenges.  And we will make our due share of contribution to maintaining and promoting peace, stability and development in the Asia Pacific region and the world at large.
<br><br>
Both President Obama and I believe that when China and the United States work together, we can become an anchor of world stability and a propeller of world peace.  China stands ready to work with the United States to firm up our confidence, exercise our wisdom, and take action to strengthen our coordination and cooperation bilaterally, regionally and globally; and to effectively manage our differences on sensitive issues so that we can make new gains in building the new model of major-country relations between China and the United States, which serves the fundamental interests of our two peoples and the people elsewhere in the world.
<br><br>
China and the United States have different historical and cultural traditions, social systems, and faces of development.  So it's natural that we don't see eye to eye on every issue.  But there have always been more common interests between China and the United States than the differences between us.  Both sides should respect each other's core interests and major concerns and manage our differences in a constructive fashion, full dialogue, and consultation so as to uphold the overall interests of stable growth of China-U.S. relations.
<br><br>

And I had a candid discussion with President Obama on human rights issues.  Ever since the founding of the People's Republic of China, and especially over the last three decades and more of China's reform and opening era, China has made enormous progress in its human rights.  That is a fact recognized by all the people in the world.
<br><br>
On the question of human rights, we should never consider our work to be mission accomplished.  It's always work in progress, and there is always room for further improvement.  China stands ready to have dialogue with the United States on human rights issues on the basis of equality and mutual respect so that we can constructively handle our differences, deepen our mutual understanding, and learn from each other.
<br><br>
In my talks with President Obama I also pointed out that the Occupy Central is an illegal movement in Hong Kong.  We are firmly supportive of the efforts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to handle the situation according to law so as to maintain social stability in Hong Kong and protect the life and the property of the Hong Kong residents.  Hong Kong affairs are exclusively China's internal affairs, and foreign countries should not interfere in those affairs in any form or fashion.  And we will protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign citizens and business organizations in Hong Kong, as well.  And I think it goes without saying that law and order must be maintained according to law in any place, not just in Hong Kong, but also elsewhere in the world.
<br><br>
China and the United States are important countries in the world.  It's perfectly normal for there to be different views expressed about us in the international media.  And I don't think it's worth fussing over these different views.  And I don't see any of the regional free-trade arrangements as targeting against China.  China is committed to open regionalism.  And we believe the various regional cooperation initiatives and mechanisms should have positive interaction with each other, and that is the case at the moment.
<br><br>
And China protects our citizens' freedom of expression and the normal rights and the interests of media organizations in accordance with law.  On the other hand, media outlets need to obey China's laws and regulations.  When a car breaks down on the road, perhaps we need to get off the car to see where the problem lies.  And when a certain issue is raised as a problem, there must be a reason.  In Chinese, we have a saying:  The party which has created a problem should be the one to help resolve it.  So perhaps we should look into the problem to see where the cause lies.
<br><br>
Thank you.
<br><br>
MODERATOR:  This is the end of the press conference.  Thank you, President Xi and President Obama.  Thank you all.
<br><br>

Health Care that Works for Americans<br><br>
On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, putting in place comprehensive reforms that improve access to affordable health coverage for everyone and protect consumers from abusive insurance company practices. 
<br><br>
For those Americans who already have health insurance, the only changes you will see under the law are new benefits, better protections from insurance company abuses, and more value for every dollar you spend on health care. If you like your plan you can keep it and you don’t have to change a thing due to the health care law. The President addressed concerns from Americans who have received letters of policy cancellations or changes from their insurance companies in an interview with NBC News, watch the video or read a transcript. 
<br><br>
For the uninsured or those who don’t get their coverage through work, a key component of the Affordable Care Act will take effect on October 1, when the new Health Insurance Marketplace open for business, allowing millions of Americans to comparison shop for a variety of quality, affordable plans that best meet their health care needs.
<br><br>
Here are the key facts about the Affordable Care Act.
<br><br>
Stronger Consumer Rights and Protections <br><br>
105 million Americans no longer have lifetime dollar limits on their coverage.
<br><br>
More than 17.6 million children with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage. <br><br>
More Affordable Coverage <br><br>
Private insurers that provide coverage for nearly 174 million Americans must now justify double-digit premium increases, and nearly 76 million Americans are covered by insurers that are now required to spend at least 80% of premium dollars on health care. <br><br>

360,000 small businesses received a tax credit in 2011 to help them pay for health insurance for an estimated 2 million workers.<br><br>
Better Access to Care <br><br>
54 million Americans now can receive a free preventive service, such as cancer screenings, through their private insurance plan.<br><br>

3.1 million young adults have coverage on a parent’s plan through age 26.
<br><br>
More than 50,000 Americans with pre-existing conditions have gained coverage through the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan.<br><br>
Stronger Medicare <br><br>
3.6 million people received a 50% discount―worth an average of $604 each―on brand name prescription drugs after hitting the Medicare donut hole in 2011.
<br><br>
More than 32.5 million seniors received one or more free preventive services.
<br><br>
The average person with Medicare will save about $4,200 from 2011 to 2021. Those with high prescription costs will save up to $16,000.<br><br>
In the past, insurance companies could take advantage of you. They could deny coverage to children who had asthma or were born with a heart defect, put a lifetime cap on the amount of care they would pay for, or cancel your coverage when you got sick just by finding an accidental mistake in your paperwork. The Affordable Care Act creates a new Patient’s Bill of Rights that protects you from these and other abusive practices.
<br><br>
End to Pre-Existing Condition Discrimination: Insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to children because of a pre-existing condition like asthma and diabetes, providing peace of mind for parents of the more than 17.6 million children with pre-existing conditions. Starting in 2014, no American can be discriminated against due to a pre-existing condition.<br><br>

End to Limits on Care: In the past, some people with cancer or other chronic illnesses ran out of insurance coverage because their health care expenses reached a dollar limit imposed by their insurance company. Under the health care law, insurers can no longer impose lifetime dollar limits on essential health benefits and annual limits are being phased out by 2014. More than 105 million Americans no longer have lifetime limits thanks to the new law.
<br><br>
End to Coverage Cancellations: Insurance companies can no longer drop your coverage when you get sick due to a mistake you made on your application.<br><br>
The law helps you by bringing down health care costs and making sure your health care dollars are spent wisely. Insurance companies will now be accountable to their customers for how they are spending premium dollars, and how much they are raising rates. Plus, the new law will help lower costs through new tax credits and new marketplaces where insurers will have to compete for your business.<br><br>
Value for Your Premium Dollar: Thanks to the Affordable Care Act’s 80/20 rule, if insurance companies don’t spend at least 80 percent of your premium dollar on medical care and quality improvements rather than advertising, overhead and bonuses for executives, they will have to provide you a rebate. In 2012, 8.5 million people received half a billion dollars in refunds.
<br><br>
Stopping Unreasonable Rate Increases: In every State and for the first time ever, insurance companies are required to publicly justify their actions if they want to raise rates by 10 percent or more.
<br><br>
Small Business Tax Credits: Small businesses have long paid a premium price for health insurance C often 18 percent more than larger employers. The tax credit will benefit an estimated 2 million workers who get their insurance from an estimated 360,000 small employers who will receive the credit in 2011 alone.<br><br>
The health care law builds on what works in our health care system. And it fixes what’s broken by providing you with more health insurance choices and better access to care.<br><br>

Free Prevention Benefits: Insurers are now required to cover a number of recommended preventive services, such as cancer, diabetes and blood pressure screenings, without additional cost sharing such as copays or deductibles. Already, 54 million Americans with private health coverage have gotten better preventive services coverage as a result.
<br><br>
Coverage for Young Adults: Under the law, most young adults who can’t get coverage through their jobs can stay on their parents’ plans until age 26 C a change that has already allowed 3.1 million young adults to get health coverage and given their families peace of mind.<br><br>

Coverage for Americans with Pre-Existing Conditions: Before the law, many Americans with pre-existing conditions were locked or priced out of the health insurance market. More than 50,000 Americans with pre-existing conditions have gained coverage through the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan. This temporary program makes health coverage available and more affordable for individuals who are uninsured and have been denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. In 2014, insurance discriminating against anyone with a pre-existing condition will be illegal.<br><br>

Affordable Insurance Exchanges: Affordable Insurance Exchanges are one-stop marketplaces where consumers can choose a private health insurance plan that fits their health needs. Starting in 2014, they will offer to the public the same kinds of insurance choices members of Congress will have. Exchanges will select health plans qualified to offer coverage; facilitate consumer assistance, shopping and enrollment; and coordinate eligibility for the Exchange and potential premium assistance. Already, 33 States and the District of Columbia are on their way to building Exchanges, having received at total of nearly $670 million in Exchange Establishment Grants.<br><br>
Nearly 50 million older Americans and Americans with disabilities rely on Medicare each year, and the new health care law makes Medicare stronger by adding new benefits, fighting fraud, and improving care for patients. The life of the Medicare Trust Fund will be extended to at least 2024 as a result of reducing waste, fraud, and abuse, and slowing cost growth in Medicare. And, over the next ten years, the law will save the average person in Medicare $4,200. People with Medicare who have the prescription drug costs that hit the so-called donut hole will save an average of over $16,000.
<br><br>
Lower Cost Prescription Drugs: In the past, as many as one in four seniors went without a prescription every year because they couldn’t afford it. To help these seniors, the law provides relief for people in the donut hole C the ones with the highest prescription drug costs. As a first step, in 2010, nearly four million people in the donut hole received a $250 check to help with their costs. In 2011, 3.6 million people with Medicare received a 50 percent discount worth a total of $2.1 billion, or an average of $604 per person, on their brand name prescription drugs when they hit the donut hole. Seniors will see additional savings on covered brand-name and generic drugs while in the coverage gap until the gap is closed in 2020.<br><br>

Free Preventive Services: Under the new law, seniors can receive recommended preventive services such as flu shots, diabetes screenings, as well as a new Annual Wellness Visit, free of charge. So far, more than 32.5 million seniors have already received one or more free preventive services, including the new Annual Wellness Visit.
<br><br>
Fighting Fraud: The health care law helps stop fraud with tougher screening procedures, stronger penalties, and new technology. Thanks in part to these efforts, we recovered $4.1 billion in taxpayer dollars in 2011, the second year recoveries hit this record-breaking level. Total recoveries over the last three years were $10.7 billion. Prosecutions are way up, too: the number of individuals charged with fraud increased from 821 in fiscal year 2008 to 1,430 in fiscal year 2011 C nearly a 75 percent increase.<br><br>

Improving Care Coordination and Quality: Through the newly established Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, this Administration is testing and supporting innovative new health care models that can reduce costs and strengthen the quality of health care. So far, it has introduced 16 initiatives involving over 50,000 health care providers that will touch the lives of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in all 50 states.
<br><br>
Providing Choices while Lowering Costs: The number of seniors who joined Medicare Advantage plans increased by 17 percent between 2010 and 2012 while the premiums for such plans dropped by 16 percent C and seniors across the nation have a choice of health plans.<br><br>

Watch Chuck Todd's full interview with President Obama<br><br>
In a wide-ranging interview with NBC's Chuck Todd, President Obama discusses implementation of the Affordable Care Act, rollout of the healthcare website, NSA spying, Iran and keeping Joe Biden as his running mate.

<br><br>
This content comes from a Full-Text Transcript of the program.<br><br>
Thanks to you. I'll start -- with health care . It's probably the most quoted thing or requoted thing you have said in your presidency, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it." You said it a lot during the run up. At this point, though, it's obviously something -- a promise that has not been able to be kept. Just today, the Denver Post 2 50,000 people in Colorado are seeing health insurance policies cancelled. Some of those people liked those policies. And they can't keep them. What happened? 
<br><br>
Well -- first of all, I meant what I said. And we worked hard to try to make sure that we implemented it properly. But obviously, we didn't do enough -- a good enough job -- and I regret that. We're talking about 5% of the population -- who are in what's called the individual market . They're out there buyin' health insurance on their own. 
<br><br>
A lot of these plans are subpar plans. And we put in a clause in the law that said if you had one of those plans, even if it was subpar -- when the law was passed, you could keep it. But there's enough churn in the market that folks since then have bought subpar plans. And now that may be all they can afford. So even though it only affects a small amount of the population, you know, it means a lot to them, obviously, when they get -- this letter cancelled. 
<br><br>
And -- you know, I am deeply concerned about it. And I 've assigned my team to see what we can do to close some of the holes and gaps in the law -- because, you know, my intention is to lift up and make sure the insurance that people buy is effective. That it's actually going to deliver what they think they're purchasing. Because what we know is before the law was passed, a lot of these plans, people thought they had insurance coverage. And then they'd find out that they had huge out of pocket expenses. Or women were being charged more than men. 
<br><br>
If you had preexisting conditions, you just couldn't get it at all. And we are proud of the consumer protections we put into place . On the other hand , we also want to make sure that -- nobody is put in a position where their plan's been cancelled. They can't afford a better plan, even though they'd like to have a better plan. And so we're gonna have to work hard -- to make sure that those folks -- are, you know, taken care of. 
<br><br>
Do you feel like you owe these folks an apology for misleading them? 
<br><br>
You know -- 
<br><br>
Even if you didn't intentionally do it, but at this point, they feel misled. And you've seen the anger that's out there. 
<br><br>
You know -- I regret very much that -- what we intended to do, which is to make sure that everybody is moving into better plans because they want 'em, as opposed to because they're forced into it. That, you know, we weren't as clear as we needed to be -- in terms of the changes that were takin' place . And I want to do everything we can to make sure that people are finding themselves in a good position -- a better position than they were before this law happened. 
<br><br>
Keep in mind that most of the folks who are gonna -- who got these c -- cancellation letters, they'll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces. Because they'll have more choice. They'll have more competition. They're part of a bigger pool. Insurance companies are gonna be hungry for their business. 
<br><br>
So -- the majority of folks will end up being better off, of course, because the website 's not workin' right. They don't necessarily know it right. But it -- even though it's a small percentage of folks who may be disadvantaged, you know, it means a lot to them. And it's scary to them. And I am sorry that they -- you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me. We've got to work hard to make sure that -- they know -- we hear 'em and that we're gonna do everything we can -- to deal with folks who find themselves -- in a tough position as a consequence of this.<br><br> 

You've been getting some tough criticism on this quote. Clarence Page , your hometown newspaper, The Chicago Tribune , this is not -- not White House. He's been pretty supportive of what you said. He characterized this as a political lie. He called it a sort of -- "the sort of rosy promise politicians sometimes make with such passion and confidence that they actually may have convinced even themselves that it is true." did politics play a role and you felt as if as the Republicans were throwin' stuff at the law that you're tryin' to pass it. You're tryin' to do this, that you shorthanded this? <br><br>

No, I -- I think we, in good faith, have been trying to take on a health care system that has been broken for a very long time. And what we've been trying to do is to change it in the least disruptive way possible. I mean, keep in mind that there were folks on the left who would have preferred a single payer plan. That would have been a lot more disruptive. There were folks on the right who said, "Let's just get rid of -- you know, employer deductions for health care . And give people -- a tax credit and they can go buy their own health care in their own market ." That would have been more disruptive. <br><br>

We tried to find -- a proven model. We've seen it work in Massachusetts . That would be as -- as undisruptive as possible. And in good faith, tried to write the law in such a way that people could keep their care. Although we really believe that ultimately, they're gonna be better off when they're buying health care through the marketplaces. They can -- access tax credits. And they're benefiting from more choice and competition. But obviously, we didn't do a good enough job in terms of how we crafted the law. And, you know, that's somethin' that I regret. That's somethin' that we're gonna do everything we can to get fixed. In the meantime -- 
<br><br>
By the way, that sounds like you're supportive of this legislation. 
<br><br>
Well, you -- you know -- 
<br><br>
Various things that are out there. 
<br><br>
We're -- we're looking at -- a range of options. But the one thing I want to emphasize, though, Chuck , is everybody is acting as if the existing market was working. And the fact of the matter is that a whole lot of people who were in this individual market , who were buyin' health care on their own, because they're not gettin' it through their employer, they might be happy with it this year. And then suddenly next year, the cost got jacked up by 15%-20%. 
<br><br>
The average increase on premiums in this individual market for somebody who kept their -- health care for awhile, the average increase was double digits. If they -- actually got sick and used the insurance , they might find the next year their premiums had gone up. Or the insurer might have dropped them altogether, because now they had a preexisting condition. 
<br><br>
Women were being charged as much as double compared to men. So this is a market that wasn't working. And a whole lot of people were dissatisfied. And what we've done is to increase the consumer protections that are in place for those families and those folks . We've said, "You can't drop people when they get sick and need it most." We've said that you can't -- you know, have lifetime limits so that suddenly people think they've got insurance , the next thing they know they've got $30,000-$40,000 out of pocket expenses. 
<br><br>
And over the long term, that is the right thing to do. But in this transition, you know, there are gonna be folks who get a cancellation letter, especially when a website 's not workin'. They're lookin' and sayin', "What am I gonna do now?" And -- you know, we have to make sure that they -- are not feeling as if they've been betrayed by an effort that -- is designed to help them. 
<br><br>
Do you feel -- considering how much this quote has been -- it's late night, it's all sorts of things, that -- do you understand that people are gonna be skeptical of the next promise you make, of the next -- or are you concerned that people are gonna be wondering, "Jeez, what is the fine print that he's not telling me?" Do you get that people might be a little more skeptical? Forget the partisans here in Washington , just average Americans. 
<br><br>
You know, I -- I -- I'll tell you, Chuck . I -- I think that -- I've now been in national public life for seven, eight years. I've been president for -- almost five. And I think for the most part people know that I speak my mind and I tell folks what I think and I've been very clear about what I'm trying to do. And I think most people know that -- even if they disagree with me on certain issues -- that I'm every day workin' hard to try to make life a little bit better for middleclass families who are -- and folks who are tryin' to get in the middleclass who are doin' the right thing and bein' responsible. 
<br><br>
I think what most people I hope also recognize is that when you try to do something big like make our health care system better that there're gonna be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you're doing is gonna make a whole lot of people better off. And -- I hope that people will -- look at the end product. And they're gonna be able to look back and say, "You know what? We now have protections that we didn't have before. We've gotten more choice and competition. I didn't have health insurance . I now have it. I had bad health insurance . I now have good health insurance . The website 's actually workin'. I'm getting -- " 
<br><br>
" -- I'm getting -- you know, I'm getting -- you know, my kid on my insurance plan, even though he's got asthma or some other preexisting condition." So ultimately, I think I'll be judged on whether this thing is better for people overall. And in the meantime, even if it's a small percentage of people. I mean, we're talkin' about 5% of the population. But -- but that's -- a significant number of people. Even though a whole lot of them are gonna be better off. There's gonna be a segment who -- you know, I've ultimately gotta make sure that -- you know, I'm speakin' to their needs and their concerns. And, you know -- I take that very seriously, because I want everybody out there to know that, you know, my entire intention here is to make sure that -- people have the security of affordable health care . 
<br><br>
You have 21 days until November 30th . Is this website gonna be running smoothly enough? If it's not, at that point, do you sit there and say, "Okay, let's extend the enrollment period. Let's delay the mandate." Do all of those plan B 's start coming into focus if November 30th hits? 
<br><br>
Well, that -- let me just say generally -- and I don't think I'm sayin' anything that people don't know and I haven't said before. I am deeply frustrated about -- how this website has not worked over the first couple of weeks. And, you know, I take responsibility of that. My team take responsibility of that. And we are working every single day, 24/7, to improve it. And it's better now than it was last week. And it's certainly a lot better than it was on October 1st . 
<br><br>
I'm confident that it will be even better by November 30th and that the majority of people are gonna be able to get on there. They're gonna be able to enroll. They're gonna be able to apply. And they're gonna get a good deal -- a better deal than they've got right now when it comes to buyin' health insurance . 
<br><br>
Now that -- you know, having said that -- given that I've been burned already with -- a website -- well, more importantly, the American people have been burned by -- a website that has been dysfunctional. What we've also been doing is creating a whole other set of tracks. Makin' sure that people can apply by phone effectively. Making sure that people can apply in person effectively. So what I'm confident about is that anybody who wants to buy health insurance through the marketplace, they are gonna be able to buy it. And -- 
<br><br>
So no delays? You -- you have no -- 
<br><br>
Well -- 
<br><br>
 
Keep in mind -- keep in mind that the open enrollment period, the period during which you can buy health insurance is available all the way until March 31st . And we're only five weeks into it. So we've got a whole bunch of time not only to get the website fixed, to work out all the kinks, to make sure that everybody has the information that they need. And what we'll do is -- continue to assess if there are roadblocks for people, we're gonna clear out those roadblocks. We are gonna make sure that they can access -- 
<br><br>
-- whatever it takes? 
<br><br>
Whatever it takes for people to be able to get what is good-quality health insurance at cheaper prices or better insurance for the same price as bad insurance -- that they've got right now. We're gonna make sure that they have access to that market . 
<br><br>
You still have full confidence in Kathleen Sebelius ? 
<br><br>
You know, I think Kathleen Sebelius , under tremendously difficult circumstances over the last four and a half years -- has done a great job in setting up -- the insurance markets so that there is a good product out there for people to get. You know, Kathleen Sebelius doesn't write code. Yeah, she wasn't our I.T. person . I think she'd be the first to admit that -- if we had to do it all over again, that there would have been a whole lot more questions that were asked, in terms of how this thing is working. But my priority right now is to get it fixed. And -- you know, ultimately, the buck -- 
<br><br>
Is she still the right person ? 
<br><br>
Ultimately, the buck stops with me. You know, I'm the president. This is my team. If it's not working, it's my job to get it fixed. 
<br><br>
I want to talk about a larger question. You've discussed the website issue. But there seems to be this growing p -- perception, some of it is the -- press reporting, some of it's your staff, that you're not always on top of some things. Or this idea that you didn't know certain things. So, for instance, we talked about the website . Did the warnings get to your desk or not? N.S.A., did you -- did you really not know you were tapping Angela Merkel 's phone until Edward Snowden leaked it? 
<br><br>
Well, look -- these are two different issues. First of all, I can guarantee you that I've been more deeply involved in our intelligence -- operations -- on a whole set of areas where there are real threats against us than just about any president. Well, let me put it this way. As much as any president. When I am presented intelligence , particularly if it pertains to allies like Germany -- I'm not pokin' and probing about where -- 
<br><br>
You didn't --<br><br> 

-- we get certain information. 
<br><br>
You didn't know this until after ? 
<br><br>
The -- if we're talking about Al Qaeda . If we're talking about -- you know, other states that pose a threat to the United States , then not only am I interested in the information, but also how we obtained it, because that's -- very relevant. There's no doubt when it comes to the N.S.A. generally that -- over the last, you know, 30, 40, 50 years, we have tried to extend our intelligence capabilities all around the world . That's what every intelligence agency does. What's changed is technology. What's changed is capacity. We're just so much better than -- anybody else at this. And technology has given us so much more reach than in the past -- 
<br><br>
-- that now we've got -- we've got to adapt to the architecture of what we do to our capacity. In -- in some ways, the technology and the budgets and the capacity have outstripped the constraints. And we've got to rebuild those in the same way that we're havin' to do on -- a whole series of capacities, military, you know, what we do in terms of -- you know, our drone operations. 
<br><br>
So -- so that's a whole big piece of business. But this idea that somehow -- every president is -- you know, looking at the raw intelligence and figuring out what sources those are, that's just not the case. You know, I think that my previous reputation was that I was this policy wonk that was diggin' into stuff all the time. 
<br><br>
And -- and -- and -- was -- was immersed in the details. I think that stereotype is probably a little more true than -- the latest one. But -- listen, when you've got the -- a health care rollout that is as important to the country and to me as this is and it doesn't work like a charm, that's my fault. That's somethin' that I've got to -- I've gotta do -- some examination of how that happened. And rather than push down blame on a whole bunch of people underneath me, you know, the easiest thing to do is to, you know -- fire a whole bunch of folks and say, you know -- that -- you know, w -- "They should have done this. They should have done that." My job right now is to make sure that with the assets that we have, we get it done, we get it fixed, and, you know, there are gonna be some lessons learned . I'll -- I'll give you one example -- very quickly. 
<br><br>
You know, one of the lessons -- learned from this whole process on the website -- is that probably the biggest gap between the private sector and the federal government is when it comes to I.T. How we precure -- procure it, how we purchase it. This has been true on a whole range of projects. 
<br><br>
You know what your supporters say -- 
<br><br>
How did you -- how did you not be able to do this? 
<br><br>
Right. Well, the reason is is that when it comes to my campaign, I'm not constrained by a bunch of federal procurement rules, right? And how we write -- specifications and -- and how the -- the whole things gets built out. So part of what I'm gonna be looking at is how do we across the board, across the federal government , leap into the 21st century. Because when it comes to medical records for veterans, it's still done in paper. 
<br><br>
Medicaid is still largely done on paper. When we buy I.T. services generally, it is so bureaucratic and so cumbersome that a whole bunch of it doesn't work or it ends up being way over cost. And yeah, in some ways, I should have anticipated that just because this was important and I was saying this was my top priority. And I was meeting with folks once a month telling 'em, "Make sure this works." 
<br><br>
Understanding that you had some structural problems there -- you know, that's on me. That's something that I've got to -- refocus on. And -- I actually think that once we get this -- this particular website fixed, there are gonna be some lessons learned that we can apply to -- the federal government generally. 
<br><br>
All right, let me take advantage of those two more questions. negotiations on easing sanctions against Iran start tomorrow, essentially. This -- or they've been going on, but there's -- more talks tomorrow. Why are you so sure you're gonna be able to trust the Iranians on some sort of temporary deal? Or how is it that you're going to figure out if you trust them or not -- 
<br><br>
Well, fir -- fir -- first of all -- our job is not to trust the I -- Iranians. Our job is to put in place -- mechanisms where we can verify what they're doing and not doing when it comes to their nuclear program . And the negotiations taking place are not about easing sanctions. The negotiations taking place are about how Iran begins to meet its international obligations and provide assurances not just to us but to the entire world -- 
<br><br>
-- that they are not -- 
<br><br>
-- until they do something. 
<br><br>
That they are not developing nuclear weapons , that their nuclear energy program is peaceful. And frankly, because of their actions in the past, the world doesn't trust 'em on that. That's why we're able to construct these sanctions that have squeezed them very hard. Our job now is to test how serious they are about resolving this conflict or this dispute through peace -- peaceful means, through diplomacy. 
<br><br>
And there is the possibility of a phased agreement in which the first phase would be us, you know, halting any advances on their nuclear program , rolling some potential back, and putting in place -- a way where we can provide them some -- very modest relief, but keeping the sanctions architecture in place , keeping the core sanctions in place , so that if it turned out during the course of the six months when we're tryin' to resolve some of these bigger issues that they're backing out of the deal, they're not following through on it, or they're not willin' to go forward and finish the job of -- giving us assurances that they're not developing a nuclear weapon . We can crank that dial back up. 
<br><br>
So we don't have to trust them. What we have to do is to make sure that there is a good deal in place from the perspective of us verifying what they're doin'. And that they're actually movin' in the right direction. We can test it. We don't have to dismantle sanctions to do it. If, in fact -- that proves to be -- a possibility, then -- it's greatly preferable to us ratcheting up that conflict higher and higher, which ultimately might lead to -- some sort of confrontation. 
<br><br>
And I 've said that I won't take any options off the table, including military options, to prevent Iran from -- getting a nuclear weapon . But -- the best way to -- assure ourselves that -- Iran 's not getting a nuclear weapon is if we've got a verifiable means that they have decided themselves and -- are dismantling that program -- and international organizations can see what they're doin' and we can see what they're doin'. 
<br><br>
Final question, did you really not know that your campaign was researching this idea of swapping Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton ? 
<br><br>
You know -- again, Chuck , the -- the problem that we've got -- and this goes back to the earlier question you asked. You know, I am in charge of two million people in the federal government . And that was true, by the way, even when -- I was running for president. So people do all kinds of stuff. Some of it -- they clear with me, sometimes they're tryin' to figure somethin' out -- particularly on the political side. And I 'm not somebody who delves into polling and -- all that data. 
<br><br>
Here's the one thing I can say for certain. That -- if they had asked me, I would have said there is no way that I'm not running again with Joe Biden . Because I genuinely believe that he has been one of the best vice presidents in our history. He also happens to be a friend. He also happens to be one of my most important advisors on domestic foreign policy . I like him. When my back's up against the wall, he has my back. And -- 
<br><br>
You know -- I've now been in this town long enough to know that -- folks like to seem important by gettin' -- their version of events in the press -- or books or what have you. And, you know, that's just kind of part of the atmosphere that you live in. 
<br><br>
Did you and the vice president talk? 
<br><br>
Absolutely. And -- and I -- what I told him -- and he knows and he believes me is that -- I would not -- I would not be here if it weren't for the support that I've had from Joe Biden . He -- he is a personal friend and -- advisor. It's one of the best decisions that I've ever made was selecting him as vice president. I couldn't be prouder of the job that he's done. 
<br><br>
Thank you, sir. 

<br><br>Thank you.

美否认防长因质疑白宫丢官 称反IS策略将改进<br><br>
2014-11-26   环球时报 <br><br>
据美国《基督教科学箴言报》11月25日报道，日前，美国国防部长查克・哈格尔（Hagel）向美国总统奥巴马递交辞呈。哈格尔的辞职引发外界对美打击“伊斯兰国(IS)”战略转向的猜测，国防部回应称，哈格尔辞职与他同白宫政策的分歧没有联系，美国打击IS的策略将不断改进。
<br><br>
作为奥巴马政府的重要成员，哈格尔的辞职被认为是奥政府政策变化的前奏，白宫正在努力捍卫其在伊拉克和叙利亚问题上的应对策略。
<br><br>
数周前，哈格尔致信总统国家安全事务助理苏珊・赖斯，认为奥巴马在叙利亚问题上未能清晰表明立场，指责美国对叙利亚采取的战略。然而，五角大楼新闻发言人海军少将约翰・卡比在日前的记者招待会上称，“国防部长宣布辞职与美国在伊斯兰国的战略没有联系”，并表示，目前打击“伊斯兰国(IS)”的战略正在显示效果并且取得了进步。他补充道，美国驻伊拉克的部队正从巴格达撤往安巴尔省西部。
<br><br>
卡比告诉记者，“哈格尔与白宫政策方面确有分歧，但这并不是哈格尔递交辞呈的主要因素。”他补充道，“哈格尔的工作就是提出他的建议，但并不是未采纳他的建议就致使他做出辞职决定。”
<br><br>
五角大楼官员随后立刻补充道，哈格尔递交辞呈并不代表白宫与国防部不合。卡比说，哈格尔本人也表示，战略需要不断修正和评估。
<br><br>

据新华社电 美国国防部长查克・哈格尔成为民主党输掉国会中期选举后受冲击的第一名内阁成员。总统贝拉克・奥巴马24日宣布，同意这名唯一的共和党籍部长辞职。<br><br>
《纽约时报》援引一些政府高级官员的话报道，奥巴马过去两个礼拜数次与哈格尔会面，21日、即上周五决定要求这名五角大楼掌门人辞职。美联社援引一名国防部高级官员的话报道，哈格尔24日一早向奥巴马递交了辞呈。
<br><br>
这些不愿公开姓名的官员说，奥巴马决定更换防长，无异于承认，应对“伊斯兰国”威胁，需要不同的策略。而共和党一直不满五角大楼现阶段的措施。白宫官员说，奥巴马会尽快宣布新防长人选。参议院批准新防长人选前，哈格尔将留任。
<br><br>

Hagel was born in North Platte, Nebraska, a son of Charles Dean Hagel, and his wife, Betty (née Dunn). His father was of German heritage, while his mother was of Polish and Irish descent.[13][14] Growing up, Hagel lived across Nebraska; in Ainsworth, Rushville, Scottsbluff, Terrytown, York and Columbus, Nebraska.[15] Hagel was the oldest of four brothers and two sisters.[16] His father, a veteran of World War II, died suddenly on Christmas morning, 1962, at the age of 39, when Hagel was 16.[17] He graduated from St. Bonaventure High School (now Scotus Central Catholic High School) in Columbus, Nebraska, in 1964, the Brown Institute for Radio and Television in 1966, and he earned a BA degree in History from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1971.<br><br>

Hagel volunteered to be drafted into the United States Army during the Vietnam War, rejecting a draft board recommendation that he go to college instead.[19] He served in the United States Army infantry in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. As a Sergeant (E-5), he served as an infantry squad leader in the 9th Infantry Division.[20] Hagel served in the same infantry squad as his younger brother Tom, and they are thought to be the only American brothers to have done so during the Vietnam War.[21] They also saved each other's lives on separate occasions.[21] Hagel received the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, two Purple Hearts, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.<br><br>

After his discharge, he worked as a radio newscaster and talk show host in Omaha from 1969 to 1971[23] while finishing college on Veterans Administration (VA) assistance under the GI Bill.<br><br>

In 1971, Hagel was hired as a staffer for Congressman John Y. McCollister (R-NE), serving until 1977. For the next four years, he worked as a lobbyist for Firestone Tire and Rubber Company,[25] and in 1980, he served as an organizer for the successful presidential campaign of former California Governor Ronald Reagan.<br><br>

After Reagan's inauguration as President, Hagel was named deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration. In 1982, however, he resigned his post over a disagreement with VA Administrator Robert P. Nimmo, who was intent on cutting funding for VA programs. Nimmo had referred to veterans groups as "greedy", and to Agent Orange as not much worse than a "little teenage acne."<br><br>
